El concierto se complet\u00f3 con una adaptaci\u00f3n realizada por el d\u00fao del tema \u201cSorpresa\u201d, que el grupo, como tr\u00edo, ya estaba tocando en directo y luego aparecer\u00eda en Los Hechos P\u00e9rez, y con otra de un tema que, a pesar de ser uno de los m\u00e1s emblem\u00e1ticos de aquel per\u00edodo, nunca fue publicado en el formato instrumental habitual de la banda, \u201cViejo Le\u00f3n (marcha solar)\u201d. Esta pieza hab\u00eda sido compuesta por encargo de Xavier Manubens para la muestra L\u2019H Art, e interpretada por la Banda Municipal de l\u2019Hospitalet en una comitiva que recorri\u00f3 las calles de Bellvitge tras un cami\u00f3n que transportaba una alcachofa gigante en cuyo interior hab\u00eda una mujer desnuda. Estos tres temas, intrerpretados por los 56 m\u00fasicos de la Banda Municipal de Tolosa en la plaza del mercado de verduras de esa ciudad, es lo que recoge este disco.

A: Tool Man I'm not sure at this point in time how the band started, but I think it was Otto who started banging out rhythms on some large oil drums late one night in the University of Kansas sculpture production room. The main sculpture studio at KU was in a large old stone room and had a great reverberating sound, perfect for loud music. Doug Davison and maybe another person joined in a series of late-night jam sessions. I didn't come into the picture until later, bringing my cheap synthesizer's and Casio\u2019s which I ran through distortion to add feedback and vocal effects to the mix. Things grew louder and longer with more and more people turning up to join in the sessions, it was so loud that people from the dorms across campus started coming over to listen. At one point we wound up with a harmonica player, heavy metal guitarist and some blues musicians trying to add their own sound into the sound rumble. \u00a0Tony Allard was working on a solo exhibit in the facility gallery in the KU Art building and Otto invited him to sit in adding vocal bits on top after we'd scared off the other players the sound almost became music. Tony asked the \"group\" to play his art opening and we became a trio playing pieces that were more like noisy nightmares. I came up with a series of promo posters that featured a construction worker clip art graphic with a humorous or vague slogan, the posters were hung in the halls of the KU, following Ottos tradition of hanging vague posters in the halls of the Art building. The posters were hung in a numbered series in an attempt to generate interest in the performance. The art opening of Tony's show was well attended, I set up a slide projector in the back of the gallery to shine slides over the group as we played and I asked a fellow student to run the slides. We started playing our \"material\" and people almost immediately started moving away, even Tony performed as far away from Otto and I as he could get to distance himself from the group. I always get pretty nervous performing so I used to never looked up from my keyboards throughout a live show, I only remember the light from the slide projector began flashing quickly from across the room. As we finished and I finally looked up and the room was completely empty, even the guy running the slides was gone, he'd jammed the button down on the projector and the slides were flashing away on their own. The only person from the audience who survived was Cara Walz, a friend from the KU's Performance Art class, she stayed and did a few vocal jams as we loaded up our equipment, this was the start of the next band \"Zygote Totem\". And that was the end of Tool Man, although.. the posters had a kind of success on their own and are still hanging up around the KU campus.

The tape has never been heard before because at the time it was recorded rather poorly as an afterthought and the levels were too high, leaving the tape distorted\u2026 also the tape was a normal bias 120 minute extended length tape, which are notoriously low-fi\u2026 but I thought it would be fun to see what could be done with pro tools to tape of very dubious quality of a local band of interest, being one of the few documents of this band live, featuring songs probably never played or heard again, from over 25 years ago\u2026 this hour of music is restored to listenable quality for all who were there and those who wish they were, to enjoy again\u2026 I did my best, but some parts of the tape were just saturated\u2026 but mostly, I was surprised at what could be done with phase cancellation, and about 10 hours of tweaking and many many subtle filters\u2026 at the end of the program you can hear the first from the tape, in its' original form. Just to give you an idea of what I had to work with.

In 1935, the title was changed to The Bayonet, but returned to its earlier title, Student Handbook, in the 1957-58 issue. The handbook contains rules and regulations governing the student body as well as conduct policies, campus traditions, and information for incoming freshmen. The Student Handbook became a digital publication beginning with the 2013-14 issue.","title":"Student Handbook (1989-1990)"},{"date":"1990-01-25T00:00:00Z","identifier":"UNCPT0310001","subject":["Student television","University of North Carolina at Pembroke"],"description":"Spine of Case: Dr. Combs & Temple, DVM, \"Pet Care\", Unedited, 1-25-90","title":"Dr. Combs and Temple, \"Pet Care\", 25 January 1990"},{"date":"1990-08-20T00:00:00Z","identifier":"UNCPT0520001","subject":["Locklear, Gene.","Lumbee art--20th century--Exhibitions."],"description":"Spine of Case: Art Dedication, 8\/20\/90","title":"Art Dedication, 20 August 1990"},{"date":"1990-04-19T00:00:00Z","identifier":"UNCPT1860001","subject":["Student television","University of North Carolina at Pembroke"],"description":"Front of Case: Aubrey R.

Umbruch in der DDR \u2013 Interviewausschnitte (Redaktion & Schnitt: Jan Henselder ) Informationen zur Videoreihe Im Fr\u00fchjahr 1990 f\u00fchrten Dr. Horst Lange und Dr. Uwe Matthes Interviews mit Michael Arnold, Tatjana B\u00f6hm, Rainer Eppelmann, Dr. Gottfried Forck, Dr. Gregor Gysi, Klaus H\u00f6pcke, Walter Janka, Prof. Dr. J\u00fcrgen Kuczynski, Gerd Poppe, Friedrich Schorlemmer, Prof. Dr. Dieter Segert, Dr. Wolfgang Ullmann, Dr. Christine Weiske, Konrad Wei\u00df, Prof. Dr. Dieter Wittich und Peter Zimmermann zu den Ereignisse und Ursachen der \u201eWende\u201c. Die Produktion erfolgte durch das Institut f\u00fcr Film, Bild und Ton (IFBT) , welches in der DDR von 1964 bis 1990 f\u00fcr die Erstellung von audiovisuellen Lehrmitteln f\u00fcr Hochschulen und andere wissenschaftliche Institutionen zust\u00e4ndig war. Die Videoreihe ist eine der wenigen Videoproduktionen des Instituts. Sie zeigt einerseits ein Stimmungsbild der f\u00fchrenden Akteure der Wende kurz vor den ersten freien Wahlen am 18.3.1990 und andererseits, wie sich die staatliche Institution IFBT versucht, in Anbetracht einer ver\u00e4nderten Gesamtsituation neu zu positionieren. Unter anderem gehen die Interviews folgenden Fragen nach: \u2022 Durch welche politischen Kr\u00e4fte erh\u00e4lt der Erneuerungsprozess seine entscheidenden Impulse? \u2022 Welche Rolle spielte die Kirche bei der Formierung der Opposition? \u2022 Worin bestehen die Ursache der Krise? \u2022 Wie ist der Verlauf der Ereignisse von Herbst \u201889 und Fr\u00fchjahr \u201890 zu bewerten? \u2022 Wie werden Tempo und Tiefe der Ver\u00e4nderungen und der darin eingeschlossene Lernprozess durch die verschiedenen politischen Kr\u00e4fte reflektiert? \u2022 Wie entwickelte sich das Konzept von der Einheit Deutschlands? \u2022 Welche Rolle spielte der Runde Tisch bei der \u00dcberwindung der administrativen-zentralistischen Gesellschaftsstrukturen und stalinistischer Denk- und Verhaltensmuster? \u2022 In welcher Weise wird die Erneuerung der einst wichtigsten St\u00fctze des deutschen Stalinismus, der SED und sp\u00e4teren PDS, im politischen Spektrum hierzulande reflektiert? Die Interviews sollten urspr\u00fcnglich auf VHS-Videokassetten an Schulen und Bildungseinrichtungen vertrieben werden. Bedingt durch die Aufl\u00f6sung des IFBT im September 1990 kam die Produktion jedoch nicht mehr in den Vertrieb. Die durch altersbedingte Verfallsprozesse bedrohte Videointerviewreihe wurden 2008 zuf\u00e4llig im Medienarchiv der Hochschule f\u00fcr Technik und Wirtschaft entdeckt und 2011 mit Mitteln der Bundesstiftung zur Aufarbeitung der SED-Diktatur digital gesichert und transkribiert. *********************************************************************************************** Die Interviews k\u00f6nnen im Archiv der Bundesstiftung zur Aufarbeitung der SED-Diktatur, Kronenstr. 5, 10117 Berlin gesichtet werden. ************************************************************************************************ Die Transkripte der Interviews k\u00f6nnen bei VISUAL CULTURE PRESS bestellt werden. ************************************************************************************************ Unter dem Veranstaltungstitel: Innenansichten.

Includes: First Stores: Six Classic Fairy stories for Young Children. Little Red Riding Hood Three Little Pigs Goldilocks Rumpelstiltskin Sleeping Beauty Cinderella Traditional fairy stories have enduring magic and never-ending fascination for generations of children. These stores, illustrated with a delightful freshness and with charming detail by Stephen Cartwright, have been especially chosen to appeal to the very young. They are carefully adapted for video with music, sound effects, and narration to enchant your children again and again. Dragons, Giants, and Witches: Classic Myths and Legends. Dragons: Depicting stories of legendary dragon slayers and adventurous Knights, this section tells children all they could want to know about Dragons, their history and the 'old wives' tales' surrounding them. Giants: There are many stories about giants, some good and some bad, dating back as far as history itself. With Giants such as Atlas, Norwegian Trolls, Desert Sand Giants and Jordan the Swiss Giant, this section is full of fascinating information about the World's largest people. Witches: Long ago, people thought witches were horrid old women who wore black clothes and put bad spells on them. This section, however tells children about the good witches as well as the bad, their helpers - the imps, and the sayings and customs about them. Illustrated by Stephen Cartwright Farmyard Tales: Pig Gets Stuck: Curly the piglet helps himself to breakfast one morning - with disastrous consequences. The Naughty Sheep: Wooly the sheep decides she prefers flowers to grass. Mrs. Boot is not pleased. Barn on Fire: Ted, Poppy and Sam smell smoke, so they call the fire brigade - and get a surprise. The Runaway Tractor: Ted is driving the tractor; but it doesn't end up where he wants to. Pig Gets Lost: Curly isn't in his pen. Where can he be? Mrs. Boot, Poppy, Sam and Rusty set off to look for him. The Hungry Donkey: Ears the donkey goes to the Show and is very naughty indeed. Scarecrow's Secret: Why is Mr. Boot's scarecrow so good at scaring the birds - and why does it seem to be moving? Tractor in Trouble: Ted's new tractor gets caught in a storm, but all is well when Dolly the carthorse comes to help.

The image shows various ocean, land and atmospheric cloud features as they appear in three of the 408 infrared colors or wavelengths sensed by the instrument. The wavelength of 0.873 micron, represented as blue in the photo, shows regions of enhanced liquid water absorption, i.e. the Pacific and Indian oceans. The 0.984- micron band, represented as red, shows areas of enhanced ground reflection as on the Australian continent. This wavelength is also sensitive to the reflectivity of relatively thick clouds. The 0.939- micron wavelength, shown as green, is a strong water-vapor-absorbing band, and is used to accentuate clouds lying above the strongly absorbing lower atmosphere. When mixed with the red indicator of cloud reflection, the green produces a yellowish hue; this indicates thick clouds. The distinctive purplish color off the northeast coast marks the unusually shallow waters of the Great Barrier Reef and the Coral Sea. Here the blue denoting water absorption combines with the red denoting reflection from coral and surface marine organisms to produce this unusual color. The Near Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (NIMS) on the Galileo spacecraft is a combined mapping (imaging) and spectral instrument. It can sense 408 contiguous wavelengths from 0.7 micron (deep red) to 5.2 microns, and can construct a map or image by mechanical scanning. It can spectroscopically analyze atmospheres and surfaces and construct thermal and chemical maps. Sensor: Galileo\/Galileo.

casinos. Cards are dealt randomly from a 52 card deck, and \"draw cards\" are randomly dealt from the remaining 47 cards. This program assumes that the player automatically bets 5 coins in all cases. The odds on VIDEO POKER machines are such that playing any less than the 5 coin maximum increases the casino's percentage advantage. Thus, this program assumes that the player wants the most advantageous odds. There are three ways to play: 1. The teaching method allows the program to recommend the proper cards to hold to minimize the casino's advantage. Using this playing method will help the player learn which cards to hold in various situations. 2. Play without any help from the program. 3. Allow the program to automatically play while the player watches. Therefore, the (now passive) player can learn by watching which cards are held in different situations.","title":"Video Poker"},{"date":"1990-02-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"VideoReviewFebruary1990","subject":"Vintage video magazine","description":"VIDEO REVIEW magazine, 10th Anniversary Special, Big Screen TVs","title":"Video Review February 1990"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"Video_Magazin-Issue-30","subject":"Video Magazin","description":"Video Magazin Issue-30","title":"Video Magazin Issue-30"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"Video_Magazin-Issue-31","subject":"Video Magazin","description":"Video Magazin Issue-31","title":"Video Magazin Issue-31"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"Video_Magazin-Issue-32","subject":"Video Magazin","description":"Video Magazin Issue-32","title":"Video Magazin Issue-32"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"Video_Magazin-Issue-33","subject":"Video Magazin","description":"Video Magazin Issue-33","title":"Video Magazin Issue-33"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"Video_Magazin-Issue-34","subject":"Video Magazin","description":"Video Magazin Issue-34","title":"Video Magazin Issue-34"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"Video_Magazin-Issue-35","subject":"Video Magazin","description":"Video Magazin Issue-35","title":"Video Magazin Issue-35"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"Video_Magazin-Issue-36","subject":"Video Magazin","description":"Video Magazin Issue-36","title":"Video Magazin Issue-36"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"Video_Magazin-Issue-37","subject":"Video Magazin","description":"Video Magazin Issue-37","title":"Video Magazin Issue-37"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"Video_Magazin-Issue-38","subject":"Video Magazin","description":"Video Magazin Issue-38","title":"Video Magazin Issue-38"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"Video_Magazin-Issue-39","subject":"Video Magazin","description":"Video Magazin Issue-39","title":"Video Magazin Issue-39"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"Video_Magazin-Issue-40","subject":"Video Magazin","description":"Video Magazin Issue-40","title":"Video Magazin Issue-40"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"Video_Magazin-Issue-41","subject":"Video Magazin","description":"Video Magazin Issue-41","title":"Video Magazin Issue-41"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"VideodiscsInHealthcareAGuideToTheIndustry_201609","subject":["training","education"],"description":"Optical Storage Technology Pharmaceutical Companies Universities\/Colleges Hospitals Non-hospital Markets Public Organizations Professional Associations Museums Commercial Ventures Worldwide Testing & Certification Health Promotion Marketing\/Promotion CD-ROM Information Systems Videodisc Effectiveness Research Resources","title":"Videodiscs In Healthcare: A Guide To The Industry Third Edition"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"Videogame_gdree4y","subject":"videogame","description":"Life & Death 2 PC Spanish 1990 Portable","title":"Life & Death 2 PC Spanish 1990"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"Videogame_ggrte4","subject":"videogame","description":"Colorado PC Spanish 1990 Portable","title":"Colorado PC Spanish 1990"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"Videogame_ghgrrr4t","subject":"videogame","description":"Centurion PC 1990 Portable","title":"Centurion PC 1990"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"Videogame_iuyy5","subject":"videogame","description":"Capitan Trueno PC 1989 Portable","title":"Capitan Trueno PC 1990"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"Videon_III_v3.0_1990_Newtronic","description":"Videon III v3.0 (1990)(Newtronic)","title":"Videon III v3.0"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"VidiChrome_v1.11_1990_Rombo_Productions","description":"VidiChrome v1.11 (1990)(Rombo Productions)","title":"VidiChrome v1.11"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"VidikitDemoTape","subject":["vhs","graphics","animation","library"],"description":"\"VidiKIT is an animated graphics library available on subscription.\" -- description from box.","title":"VidiKIT Demo Tape"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"Vindicators_1990_Domark","description":"Commodore C64 Manual: Vindicators (1990)(Domark)","title":"Commodore C64 Manual: Vindicators (1990)(Domark)"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"VioletCrumble90","description":"From Betamax","title":"Violet Crumble (1990)"},{"date":"1990-10-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"VirginVisionAustraliaIdent1990","subject":["VHS","ident","Virgin Vision Australia","1990"],"description":"Here is this cool Virgin Vision Australia ident, complete with the 'adjust tracking control' advice and copyright warning.

This broadcast originated from a transmitter either in Iraq or Kuwait. Iraq's Voice of Peace was established in August 1990 to beam programs to American servicemen stationed in Saudi Arabia during Operation Desert Shield following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait at the beginning of the month. Programming consisted of music, initially easy-listening music but subsequently changing to a \"Top 40\" mix, news and commentary in a failed effort to try to demoralize the American troops. Beginning in September 1990, the broadcasts used a female announcer dubbed \"Baghdad Betty\" by the Americans. Reportedly, Baghdad Betty was replaced by a team of announcers sometime in December 1990. The recording is an example of the news and music programming. It is not known if the female announcer is the famous Baghdad Betty or someone else.\u00a0 Reception of the broadcast was poor to fair with slight interference and fading. At 21:58 UTC, there is interference splash from WYFR starting up on 11855 kHz. The initial frequency recorded may have been 21675 kHz before switching after a minute or so to 11860 kHz as the radio teletype interference abruptly stops at this point. The recording includes frequent station identifications such as \"You are tuned to the Voice of Peace from Baghdad.\"\u00a0 The broadcast was received in Hanwell, New Brunswick, Canada, using a Sony ICF-7600D receiver and supplied wire antenna draped around the listening room.","title":"Voice of Peace 11.860 MHz 29 December 1990 2140 UTC"},{"date":"1990-06-06T00:00:00Z","identifier":"VolcanoMc....2016","subject":"syria","description":"h","title":"(\u0633\u0644\u0645 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0636) Volcano Mc....\u0627\u0642\u0648\u0649 \u0627\u063a\u0646\u064a\u0629 \u0631\u0627\u0628 2016"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"VollmerSpaetlese1990","subject":["Unendlichkeit","Ewigkeit","Geschichte","anthropomorph","anthopozentrisch","Schwarmgeister","Feierstunden","Erleben","Suggestion","Sonnendurchmesser","Umlaufbahn","Lichtjahre","Astrophysik","Giordano Bruno","Sigrid Hunke","Europas eigene Religion","Sonnenspiegel","Binsenwahrheit","Hermann Minkowski","Felix Dahn","Odhins Trost","Vorgeschichte","Lanzenlied","Karl Hagemeister","Verhaltensforschung","offene Wunden","Disharmonie","Sonnenscheibe","Moordorf","Aurich","Ostfriesland","Bewusstsein"],"description":"Dieter Vollmer: Sp\u00e4tlese 1990, Privatdruck Sp\u00e4twerk Dieter Vollmers aus dem Jahr 1990. p { margin-bottom: 0.25cm; line-height: 115% }","title":"Dieter Vollmer: Sp\u00e4tlese"},{"date":"1990-10-25T00:00:00Z","identifier":"VoltEgszerEgyTaxisblokd44","subject":"Taxi, taxisblok\u00e1d, t\u00fcntet\u00e9s, benzin\u00e1r, Felolvas\u00f3blog","description":"\"1990 okt\u00f3ber\u00e9ben volt az \u00faj magyar demokr\u00e1cia els\u0151 v\u00e1ls\u00e1ga, a taxis blok\u00e1d.

The board from Presbyterian Hospital was started in 1884, and the board from St. Luke\u2019s Hospital was started in 1892. In 1956, the Trustees of the two hospitals merged to form Presbyterian-St. Luke\u2019s Hospital, and in 1959, the two woman\u2019s boards merged. In 1969, when the hospital joined Rush Medical College and activated the Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke\u2019s Medical Center, the woman\u2019s board became the Woman\u2019s Board of Rush-Presbyterian St. Luke\u2019s Medical Center. In 2003, the Trustees of Rush renamed the medical center Rush University Medical Center, a name that encompasses all aspects of a major medical center. To follow that leadership, the Woman\u2019s Board became the Woman\u2019s Board of Rush University Medical Center. The annual Fashion Show fundraiser was originated by the Woman\u2019s board of St. Luke\u2019s Hospital in 1927, through its merger with the Woman\u2019s Board of Presbyterian Hospital in 1959, and the development of Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke\u2019s Medical Center in 1969, and its renaming as Rush University Medical Center in 2003. The Fashion Show ran continuously through 2016. This event was not only a major resource of support for Rush and its predecessor schools and hospitals, but it was also a significant Chicago society event. Scrapbooks were maintained by Woman\u2019s Board members for each Fashion Show from 1928 to 2003. Scrapbooks mostly include news clippings related to the Fashion Show, pages from the event program, photographs, as well as relevant documents and notes from Woman\u2019s Board members. The Fashion Show materials also reference designers, exhibitors, models (\u201cmannequins\u201d), and Woman\u2019s Board membership along with the Woman\u2019s Board relationship with the hospital\/medical center.","title":"Woman\u2019s Board Fashion Show Scrapbook, 1990"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"WCLICK_ZIP","subject":["DEMU Collection Unsorted","Windows applications"],"description":"WIN3: file mgr, split windows, supports PKZIP","title":"Click!

Eazy\u2019s absence meant that Tone was given a full two hours on the wheels. And, man, was Tone in full promotion mode. Tons of great Trenton acts, special announcements about groups that were to become legendary, and even some MC Serch references. This really is a classic episode. So, side by side: Side 1 \u00a0(10:05-10:48pm) The show kicks off with some technical difficulties, but Tone steps up to the wheels (after telling Fresh J, \u201cYou\u2019re messing uuuuup!\u201d) to kick off his two hours and displays some nice turntable work when he starts things off with Gang Starr\u2019s \u201cWords I Manifest.\u201d From there, he moves into Marky Fresh\u2019s underrated \u201cMack of Rap\u201d and then hits a couple of Trenton cuts from Too Kool Posse (\u201cMusic Makes You Move\u201d) and YZ. During the first break, Tone pimps an upcoming show for the first of many times. The show sounds like a killer, put on by the Awesome Two in New York City at Quando\u2019s (which was on 9 East 2nd Ave). It featured A Tribe Called Quest, LONS, Freshco and Miz, Robbie B and DJ Jazz, Poor Righteous Teachers in their first NY appearance, and Tony D. When Tone mentions Tribe, he asks G, \u201cHave you heard of those guys?\u201d and G replies that he has but has trouble remembering the name of their first single. Seems weird now, huh? Among the tracks in the next set are \u201cThe Gas Face,\u201d which surprised me not only because they didn\u2019t cut out the repeated \u201cOh shit\u201ds, but because that was the track that kicked off the Tony D-Serch feud (quick recap: Tone mistook Serch\u2019s dis to \u201cTony Dick\u201d as a shot at him and then fired back at Serch on vinyl). Debuted on the show is one of my favorite all-time cuts that\u2019s nearly impossible to find, 360 Degrees\u2019 (made up of Prophecy and Gusto) \u201cEbony Harmony.\u201d Additionally, this is a partial version that\u2019s different from the one that wound up on their EP. In the mid-2000s, Tone was selling the EP for $500 on eBay.

Also on this side, a Tony D-voiced ad for the \u201cSound of Trenton\u201d record store, an 8-minute anti-apartheid song with Black Rock and Ron, Brand Nubian, and many others (\u201cNdodemnyama (Free South Africa)\u201d by\u00a0 Hip-Hop Against Apartheid ), the premiere of \u201cListen to Me Brother,\u201d and more Tony D, Blvd. Mosse, and PRT goodness.

BUT; they are only allowed TWO mistakes, then out they go... at that time they have the chance to view what TEN smaller words where associated with the Large word.. of course, only for TWO seconds.. even a print screen would probably be very hard to do. \u00a0The ten smaller words are made up of letters in the large word.. get the idea right, well.. get it set up and try it out yourself.. after you register, you will have access to a \"wordutil.exe\" which will allow you to add words to your worddata.dat file BUT; please DO NOT ALTER worddata.dat file with any kind of editor..\u00a0","title":"WordPlay v1.3"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"WRPIBroadcastMid1990s.t01","subject":"Taperwayne WRPI Troy NY","description":"A broadcast from WRPI Radio 91.5 FM Troy, NY Recorded: Sometime in the mid 1990s.

The demo version is limited to 40 turns play as a specific player against computer opponents of varying ability. The real game can run to hundreds of turns, and the computer opponents can be much more powerful. The title screen and a number of other graphics files have been omitted to keep the demo to a reasonable size for transmission over BBS systems. Your objectives in Warlords are brutally simple: to eliminate all organized opposition to your rule. To do this, you will have to control all eighty cities in the lands of Illuria, and thereby eliminate all seven opponents.There are many ways to achieve this, and brute force is just one of them.","title":"Warlords Demo"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"WarmUpToTraciLordsExerciseVideo1990","subject":["traci lords","exercise","fitness","vhs","1990","1990s"],"description":"1990 VHS exercise video starring Traci Lords.","title":"Warm Up To Traci Lords!"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"WarrenIN1990","subject":"Warren County (Ind.)","title":"Soil Survey of Warren County, Indiana"},{"date":"1990-12-08T00:00:00Z","identifier":"WarrenZevon1990-12-08.billydee","subject":["Live Concert","Gurf Morlix","Dan Dugmore","SBD","VHS","VHS HiFi","VHS Hi-Fi","pedigree","provenance","known lineage","billydee"],"description":"1.

Young \"This paper concerns the period in October 1962, when US aerial surveillance revealed that the Cubans were busily setting up sites for missiles delivered to Cuba by the USSR. Major Young notes that surprisingly little has been written about the military response to the Cuban Missile Crisis, as it became known. In conducting his research, the author was able to have declassified many formerly top secret operations plans and command diaries of US Navy and Marine Corps units which, as he writes, \"formed the core of a massive quarantine and planned invasion force that was larger than the Allied invasion force on D-Day\" in 1944. Major Young traces the history of the U S-Cuban relationship over the years, and the Kennedy Administration's response to the discovery of nuclear missiles in Cuba targeted at the United States. He also analyzes naval planning by a study of applicable maps, intelligence reports, and troop deployment orders for a contingency aimed at Cuba. Finally, the author discusses the probable effect on Russian leaders of an American invasion of Cuba and a quarantine of Soviet vessels bound for Cuba. Major Young concludes his paper with an assessment of the effects that the crisis continues to have on relationships with Cuba and Latin America as a whole.

The once most prestigious city in the world, has now become a fighting zone. Half of the city is left in ruins, and it is in that part of town that the marginals and gangs are living, hunted by every law enforcement agencies. The other half of the city consists of fancy mansions, in some of which the most important drug barons reside. Unfortunately, they are the ones who run the city using the enormous profits they make from dealing drugs and weapons. They now have succeeded in endangering the country's economy. The U.S. government, wanting to avoid a terrible crisis, called the CIA to run several types of operations in order to get rid of this bad substitute of government. The C.I.A., headed up by \"The Boss\", has to clean up the city of its crooks. One plan is to reorganize the city by placing security check-points at strategic positions. The operation was set up for April 4, and quickly proved to be an unprecedented success. The badly organized, smaller street gangs, were greatly outnumbered and couldn't match the extremely well armed law enforcement troops. On May 7, during a successful raid, the state police special branch, took possession of a huge arsenal of weapons and ammunition, worth more than two million dollars. This raid was an important stage in the whole operation. Realizing the sticky situation they were in, the heads of the crime organizations now started making plans for themselves: They needed to regain their control over the city and above all, secure their territories. On May 15, they kidnapped \"The Boss\" in order to get from him the names of his operatives involved in the C.I.A. fight against organized crime. This way, they were convinced they could stay in control of the situation and become even more powerful. Your mission is to liberate \"The Boss\" and to bring him back safely. You're gonna be dropped from the chopper with your panther at the spot where \"The Boss\" was last seen. You have your 357 Magnum ready and the panther is trained to protect you closely. You'll have to travel through the various parts of the city, in search of the hostage, and you will find that your street fighting skills will prove to be very useful. In each part of the city, you will confront various enemies and their gang leaders. They will become more and more skilled in combat as you progress. Some of them are so powerful that it would be wise to save bullets for these particular fights. Once you reach the point where \"The Boss\" is held prisoner, you must rescue him and safely escort him back to a safe place. On the way back, you will have to be particularly careful, since you will have to protect \"The Boss\" whose physical condition has been worn out. Wild Streets is a side-scrolling arcade game, in which you fight enemies using punches, kicks, your gun and sometimes your panther will help you. From Mobygames.com.

It is notable for its innovative and distinctive backing track, composed mostly of the band's multitracked vocals. Released in the UK in May 1975 as the second single from the band's third album The Original Soundtrack , it became the second of the group's three number-one singles in the UK between 1973 and 1978, topping the UK singles chart for two weeks. The song was also the band's breakthrough hit worldwide, reaching number one in Ireland and Canada and number two on the Billboard Hot 100 in the US, as well as reaching the top ten in Australia, New Zealand and several European countries. Written mostly by Stewart as a riposte to his wife's declaration that Stewart did not tell her he loved her often enough, \"I'm Not in Love\" was originally conceived as a bossa nova song played on guitars, but the other two members of the band, Kevin Godley and Lol Creme , disliked the track and it was abandoned. However, after hearing members of staff continue to sing the melody around their studio, Stewart persuaded the group that they should give the song another chance, to which Godley replied that for the song to work it needed to be radically changed, and suggested that the band should try and create a new version using just voices. \"I'm Not in Love\" has enjoyed lasting popularity, with over three million plays on US radio since its release, and it won three Ivor Novello Awards in 1976 for Best Pop Song, International Hit of the Year, and Most Performed British Work. [2] [3] It has featured in the films The Virgin Suicides , Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason , Indecent Proposal , Cherish , Whatever , Hunky Dory , Jappeloup , The Stud , Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo , He's Just Not That Into You , and Guardians of the Galaxy , [4] as well as the video game Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories . [5] The song has been covered by numerous artists, most notably by the American band Will to Power , whose version reached the US and Canadian top ten in 1991. Writing and composition Stewart came up with the idea for the song after his wife, to whom he had been married for eight years at that point, asked him why he didn't say \"I love you\" more often to her. Stewart said, \"I had this crazy idea in my mind that repeating those words would somehow degrade the meaning, so I told her, 'Well, if I say every day \"I love you, darling, I love you, blah, blah, blah\", it's not gonna mean anything eventually'. That statement led me to try to figure out another way of saying it, and the result was that I chose to say 'I'm not in love with you', while subtly giving all the reasons throughout the song why I could never let go of this relationship.\" Stewart wrote most of the melody and the lyrics on the guitar before taking it to the studio, where Gouldman offered to help him complete the song. Gouldman suggested some different chords for the melody, and also came up with the intro and the bridge section of the song. Stewart said that the pair spent two or three days writing the song, which at that point had a bossa nova rhythm and principally featured guitars, before playing it to Godley and Creme. Stewart recorded a version with the other three members playing the song in the studio on traditional instruments \u2013 Creme on guitar, Gouldman on bass and Godley on drums \u2013 but Godley and Creme disliked the song, particularly Godley, as Stewart later recalled: \"He said, 'It's crap', and I said, 'Oh right, OK, have you got anything constructive to add to that? Can you suggest anything?' He said, 'No. It's not working, man. It's just crap, right? Chuck it.' And we did. We threw it away and we even erased it, so there's no tape of that bossa nova version.\" [6] Having abandoned \"I'm Not in Love\", Stewart and Gouldman turned their attention to the track \" Une Nuit A Paris \", which Godley and Creme had been working on and which would later become the opening track on The Original Soundtrack album. However, Stewart noticed that members of staff in the band's Strawberry Studios were still singing the melody of \"I'm Not in Love\", and this convinced him to ask the other members of the group to consider reviving the song. Godley was still sceptical, but came up with a radical idea, telling Stewart, \"I tell you what, the only way that song is gonna work is if we totally mess it up and we do it like nobody has ever recorded a thing before. Let's not use instruments. Let's try to do it all with voices.\" [6] Although taken aback by the suggestion, Stewart and the others agreed to try Godley's idea and create \"a wall of sound\" of vocals that would form the focal point of the record. [2] Recording Stewart spent three weeks recording Gouldman, Godley and Creme singing \"ahhh\" 16 times for each note of the chromatic scale , building up a \"choir\" of 48 voices for each note of the scale. The main problem facing the band was how to keep the vocal notes going for an infinite length of time, but Creme suggested that they could get round this issue by using tape loops. Stewart created loops of about 12 feet in length by feeding the loop at one end though the tape heads of the stereo recorder in the studio, and at the other end through a capstan roller fixed to the top of a microphone stand, and tensioned the tape. By creating long loops the 'blip' caused by the splice in each tape loop could be drowned out by the rest of the backing track, providing that the blips in each loop did not coincide with each other. Having created twelve tape loops for each of the twelve notes of the chromatic scale, Stewart recorded each loop to a separate track of the mixing desk. This effectively turned the mixing desk into a musical instrument complete with all the notes of the chromatic scale, which the four members together then \"played\", fading up three or four channels at a time to create \"chords\" for the song's melody. Stewart had put gaffer's tape across the bottom of each channel, which meant it was impossible to completely fade down the tracks for each note: this resulted in the constant background hiss of vocals heard throughout the song. [2] The same voice loop effect was used in Billy Joel 's ballad \" Just the Way You Are \", released two years later. [ citation needed ] A basic guide track was recorded first in order to help create the melody using the vocals, but the proper instrumentation was added after the vocals had been recorded. In keeping with Godley's idea to focus on the voices, only a few instruments were used: a Fender Rhodes electric piano played by Stewart, a Gibson 335 electric guitar played by Gouldman for the rhythm melody, and a bass drum sound played by Godley on a Moog synthesizer which Creme had recently purchased and learnt how to program. The drum sound that was created was very soft and more akin to a heartbeat, in order not to overpower the rest of the track. The song does not feature a standard bass guitar line, but Gouldman added a bass guitar solo during the middle eight of the song, and Creme played piano during the middle eight and the bridge . The middle eight originally included lyrics, but Stewart and Gouldman were not happy with them and removed them, with Creme's piano replicating the original melody of the discarded lyrics. The middle eight and the outro also feature a toy music box which was recorded and double tracked out of phase. [2] Once the musical backing had been completed Stewart recorded the lead vocal and Godley and Creme the backing vocals, but even though the song was finished Godley felt it was still lacking something. Stewart said, \"Lol remembered he had said something into the grand piano mics when he was laying down the solos. He'd said 'Be quiet, big boys don't cry' \u2014 heaven knows why, but I soloed it and we all agreed that the idea sounded very interesting if we could just find the right voice to speak the words. Just at that point the door to the control room opened and our secretary Kathy [Redfern] looked in and whispered 'Eric, sorry to bother you. There's a telephone call for you.' Lol jumped up and said 'That's the voice, her voice is perfect!'\" [6] The group agreed that Redfern was the ideal person, but Redfern was unconvinced and had to be coaxed into recording her vocal contribution, using the same whispered voice that she had used when entering the control room. These whispered lyrics would later serve as the inspiration for the name of the 1980s band Boys Don't Cry . [ citation needed ] Release and promotion According to Stewart, at the time of recording The Original Soundtrack the band was already being courted by Mercury Records (part of the Phonogram group) to leave Jonathan King 's small UK Records label, where they were struggling financially. He said: \"I rang them. I said come and have a listen to what we've done, come and have a listen to this track. And they came up and they freaked, and they said, 'This is a masterpiece. How much money, what do you want? What sort of a contract do you want? We'll do anything.' On the strength of that one song, we did a five-year deal with them for five albums and they paid us a serious amount of money.\" [7] Despite impressing their new label with the track, Phonogram felt that it was not suitable for release as a single due to its length, and released \" Life Is a Minestrone \" as the first single from The Original Soundtrack instead. However, many influential figures in the music industry were demanding that \"I'm Not in Love\" be released as a single, and Mercury eventually bowed to the pressure and released it as the second single from the album. The band were forced to edit the track down to four minutes for radio play, but once it charted pressure from the public and the media caused the radio stations to revert to playing the full version. [6] Released in May 1975, \"I'm Not in Love\" became the band's second number-one single and stayed at the top of the UK singles chart for two weeks from 28 June. In the US the record peaked at number two in on the Billboard Hot 100 for three weeks, deprived of the top spot by a different number-one song each week ( Van McCoy 's \" The Hustle \", The Eagles ' \" One of These Nights \", and the Bee Gees ' \" Jive Talkin' \"). In the UK the single was released in its full length version of over six minutes, while in the US and Canada it was released in an edited 3:42 version, and with a different B-side . Will to Power version Will To Power recorded the song for their album Journey Home , releasing as the first single from the album in 1990. It was the band's last top ten hit, reaching number 7 on the pop charts in both the US and Canada. Deni Hines version In 1996, the Australian singer songwriter Deni Hines released \"I'm Not in Love\" as the fourth single from her debut album Imagination (1996). At the ARIA Music Awards of 1997 , \"I'm Not in Love\" was nominated for two awards - ARIA Award for Best Female Artist losing to \"Mary\" by Monique Brumby and ARIA Award for Best Pop Release losing to \" To the Moon and Back \" by Savage Garden . [36] Olive version Following their debut album, the English trip hop band Olive recorded a cover of the song. At the cusp of their new record contract with Maverick Records at the time, the band debuted the song on the label's soundtrack for the Madonna film The Next Best Thing before releasing it as the debut single from their second album, Trickle . Fronted by the lone vocals of singer Ruth-Ann Boyle , the song simulated the backing tracks of the original; the most audible modification made to the song is a percussion track in the style of drum and bass , turning the song into an upbeat dance track. Accompanied by dance-oriented remixes on the single release, the song gained sufficient nightclub play to reach number one on the Billboard Hot Dance Music\/Club Play chart (on the week of 1 July 2000), [37] as well as airplay on dance-hits format radio. [38] Other cover versions \"I'm Not in Love\" has been recorded by Petula Clark , Herv\u00e9 Vilard (French and Spanish versions in 1975), Richie Havens , Dee Dee Sharp-Gamble , Amy Grant , Grandaddy , Stanley Turrentine , Chris Standring , Johnny Logan , Richard Clayderman , Krisma , Undercover, George Monroe, with a more danceable cover version, in 1989, Deborah Blando \u2013 whose version in Portuguese, \"Somente O Sol (Only the Sun)\", was a big hit in Brazil thanks to its inclusion on the soundtrack of the soap opera Corpo Dourado (Golden Body). Other versions have been recorded by Dennis Englewood, Julia Fordham , The Pretenders , Mike Francis , Brotherhood of Man , Red Red Meat , John O'Banion , Outrageous Cherry , Chyp-Notic , Fun Lovin' Criminals , P\u00e4ivi Kautto-Niemi, The BB Band, Geb.el, Gloritone, Tori Amos , Unfinished Thought, Donny Osmond , Rick Springfield , Queen Latifah , Joey Kid from the group Trilogy , Lazlo Bane , Tex Perkins & His Ladyboyz, Rozz Williams (Accept the Gift of Sin), Juice , F. R. David , Peggy Lee [39] and Japanese singer Ryohei . Former Supreme Scherrie Payne had a club hit with her version of the song in 1982 on Megatone Records . A version of the song, arranged by Ann Odell and performed by the London Symphony Orchestra , was recorded for the 1976 album Classic Rock . In 1992, saxophonist Richard Elliot performed a cover for his album Soul Embrace . [40] British scouse house band Ultrabeat recorded a dance version of the song in 2006 with All Around the World records. The song is taken from their debut album called Ultrabeat - The Album and it appeared on Clubland 10 as \"I'm Not in Love 2006\". [ citation needed ] In 2010, Rock Sugar made a remix-cover of this song and Judas Priest 's \"Breaking the Law\" called \"Breaking the Love\" on their album Reimaginator . Also in 2010, Brazilian singer and actress Marisa Orth recorded it for her debut album Romance Volume II . In 2015 Canadian jazz singer-songwriter and pianist Diana Krall covered the song for her 12th studio album, Wallflower .","title":"Will To Power I'm Not In Love (Official Video)"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"WillemOltmansListeningToTheSilentMajority","subject":["South Africa","Apartheid","Blacks","Whites","investigative journalism","township","business","sanctions","labor issues","boycott","UDF","Desmon Tutu","foreign funding","foreign funding","posturing","poverty"],"description":"Dutch investigative journalist reports on what South Africans thought during the late 1980s.\u00a0","title":"Willem Oltmans Listening To The Silent Majority"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"Willies","subject":"Movie Trailer","description":"http:\/\/thedukemitchell.uk\/ for more weird videos plus strange film nights in London.\u00a0\u00a0 VHS trailer for the 1990 horror film The Willies, directed by Brian Peck, starring Sean Astin.","title":"The Willies (1990) Trailer"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"WilmerOLankfordTheyLivedInSomerset","subject":["Salisbury University","Edward H.

The puzzles are generated entirely at random - so running the same data file will give you different puzzles each time. This can be useful if you want to have several versions of the same puzzle or if you don't like the first version of the puzzle that is created - for example if the words are too clustered and you want them more spread out. The words are added to the puzzle in random order. You can have a maximum of 130 words in your input text file. A puzzle is generated by having the computer randomly choose N\/2 \"\"starting locations\"\" within the puzzle. N is the total number of spaces available. It then randomly chooses a direction and determines if the word can fit in the puzzle here. If not, it tries all other directions (in sequence, but randomly forwards or backwards) until the word can fit or until it fails. (This happens N\/2 times!) Note that it probably will not try N\/2 _different_ places because each is randomly generated, it may hit some of the same locations repeatedly. If the word does not fit randomly in the puzzle, the computer will randomly choose one corner of the puzzle, and will randomly choose to try across or down and will then sequentially go to very location in the puzzle and try every direction (starting with a random one). This will continue until the word fits, time runs out, or it determines that the word cannot fit into the puzzle. Although \"\"overlapping\"\" words are certainly allowed for, statistically it does not happen very often. (Depending on the puzzle size and the number and length of words to fit into it.) You can save the key and puzzle to a text file on disk where you can edit it later with a text editor or print it if you wish. You can print the puzzles from within the program or print the text file of the saved puzzle if you choose to save it.\"","title":"Word Find Puzzle Generator"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"WordPerfectMagazine-1990.01","subject":["wordperfect","word processing"],"description":"\u2026","title":"WordPerfect Magazine, January 1990"},{"date":"1990-11-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"WordPerfectMagazine-1990.11","subject":["wordperfect","word processing"],"description":"\u2026","title":"WordPerfect Magazine, November 1990"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"WordWhiz","subject":["DOS games","Vintage computer games","Educational games"],"description":"Word Whiz will test your English vocabulary knowledge.

The option are selected through an icon-based system, representing the manager's office. Training the boxers involves deciding which areas they should work on, considering their strengths and weaknesses and any damage inflicted in previous fights, and those of their next opponent. There are 97 of these in the game, so reaching the top of the rankings will take about 15-20 fights. Choosing a beatable opponent who can get the fight as high up the Friday Night bill as possible, as well as negotiating the best financial deal and a mutually agreeable dare, are the main considerations. Two different governing bodies are included in the game, each with subtly different rules. A fight in one set of rules won't be viewed quite as significantly by the other. The matches are presented from the commentary box, with the two expert analysts exchanging textual descriptions of the key punches, and who is dong the best (a clue to how any judges\u2019 decision would go).

At the time the Xapshot was introduced (late 1980s) existing digital cameras in a similar price range (less than $1,000) could not capture color, and did not have removable storage for photos, severely limiting their use.

I haven't seen this show on the tracker since I joined Dime about 6 years ago. Although it's from a soundboard source (possibly ALD), it has some speed problems and dragging - especially at the beginning of the show. I tried to correct the major speed issues, but problems remain. I think the issues start to lessen around the CTTE mark and show sounds really nice from that point on. Also, there are some annoying ticks throughout the show especially noticable between tracks. I'll post samples. Enjoy.

It is a soundboard but it is not a 'pristine' soundboard. Some hiss is present. So I would rate it 9+ at best.

Time now to conclude my little ABWH series with their final show. I was very sad when they hooked up with Yes West, so for me this tape represents the end of an all-too-short era in Yeshistory. A bit of Yes trivia....Yes once held the record for most sellouts at MSG - 18 - after their sold-out 3 night run in 1980 for the Drama tour. It was interesting to see the photo of the Drama lineup holding up their hockey jerseys with the #18 on the back, as if it was that particular band that had sold out MSG 18 times.... :) Anyway, this tour was a lifetime highlight for me....I saw them 20 times and had way too much fun traveling, meeting cool people and listening to some great music. Hope you all have enjoyed our recordings, there will be a few Masters from the Union tour in the future, including our spectacular Worcester recording....don't know when the transfers will get done, summer is coming and its hard to stay inside, but it will all get out eventually.... Special thanks to Carl for doing such a great job with the transfers, to all my old Yesfriends for making this tour special and especially the musicians for making it all happen in the first place. Thanks also to those who stay on to help seed.... The more generous you are with your music, the more it comes back to you.

Published by Sierra On-Line, Inc. Developed by Game Arts Co., Ltd. Released 1990 Also For PC-88, Sharp X1 Genre Action, Role-Playing (RPG) Perspective Side view Visual 2D scrolling Art Anime \/ manga Gameplay Metroidvania, Platform Setting Fantasy Description The ancient demon Jashiin has slept for two thousand years. When he awakens, he directs his wrath towards the kingdom of Zeliard, whose rulers of yore have allegedly harmed him. For 115 days, a sand rain devastates the kingdom, turning it into a desert. To complete his cruel revenge, Jashiin turns Felicia, the princess of Zeliard, into a stone. The valiant Duke Garland sets out on a quest to vanquish the demon and restore the princess to her true form. To do that, he must collect the Nine Tears of Esmesanti, which alone can reverse the terrible curse. Zeliard is a side-scrolling action game with platforming and role-playing elements. The game world is divided into hostile labyrinths, which occupy its largest portion and contain maze-like passages for Duke Garland to traverse, as well as enemies that must be dealt with. Crests and keys must often be collected in order to ensure the progress to the next area. Garland takes damage from enemy attacks as well as the environment (hidden spikes, high temperature, etc.), but suffers no damage should he fall off a platform. The hero uses his sword to combat the enemies, and shield to defend himself. He can also learn and cast projectile offensive magic. Special items can restore his health, increase the damage inflicted with the sword, grant additional protection, etc. Various types of clothes can be equipped; these can bestow the hero with further enhancements and immunities, such as prevent him from slipping on ice, allow him to jump higher, etc. The Duke will visit different towns during his journey. In these towns, he can rest, replenishing his health, purchase and repair weapons and armor, acquire potions, and learn magic spells. Currency is obtained by exchanging enemy spirits for gold in banks. These spirits (called \"almas\") also serve as experience points: after the player has obtained a sufficient amount of them, the protagonist receives upgrades to his health and magic points from a local town sage.

The problem is that, with Hell full, Zombies are walking the earth, devouring humans as they please. Zombi is a point and click adventure game in which you control the four characters (Alexandre, Sylvie, Yannick and Patrick) in turn, taking each of them individually through the abandoned complex. Lots of potentially-useful items have been left behind, some stored in cupboards - work out what they could be used for. Try to find a weapon with which to attack the zombies - bare-hands fighting only works for a few attempts before your character is worn out. Dead zombies should be placed in the freezer in the basement to stop them re-emerging. You have free rein over the shopping mall, and can use the bed shops to rest and the food shops for nourishment. Be wary of the dark and zombie-filled basement though. From Mobygames.com.

Because morphologically identical words in even closely related dialects can frequently differ in both meaning and nuance, their consolidation into one dictionary entry is often misleading. Scholars now realize the need to treat each dialect separately, and in A Dictionary of Jewish Palestinian Aramaic, Michael Sokoloff provides a complete lexicon of the dialect spoken and written by Jews in Palestine during the Byzantine period, from the third century C.E. to the tenth century. Sokoloff draws on a wide range of sources, from inscriptions discovered in the remains of synagogues and on amulets, fragments of letters and other documents, poems, and marginal notations to local Targumim, the Palestinian Midrashim and Talmud, texts addressing religious law (halacha), and Palestinian marriage documents (ketubbot) from the Arabic period. Many of these sources were unavailable to previous lexographers, who based their dictionaries on corrupt nineteenth-century editions of the rabbinic literature. The discovery of new manuscripts in both European libraries and the Cairo Geniza over the course of the twentieth century has revolutionized the textual basis of Jewish Palestinian Aramaic. Each entry in A Dictionary of Jewish Palestinian Aramaic is divided into six lemma or root, part of speech, English gloss, etymology, semantic features, and bibliographic references. Sokoloff also includes an index of all cited passages. This major reference work, updated to reflect the publication of new texts over the last decade, will both provide students and scholars with a tool for an accurate understanding of the Aramaic dialect of Jewish Palestinian literature of the Byzantine period and help Aramaist and Semitic linguists to see the relationship between this dialect and others, especially the contemporary dialects of Palestine.

About to be split up and sent to foster homes, they located a cranky old homeless man and offered him food, a home, and a decent life-style if he would live in their nice house and pose as their grandfather (this could only happen in a sitcom!). Of course he took his new responsibilities more seriously than they expected, and amid the quips, little lessons in life were learned by all around the sunny kitchen table. Roger was the helpful next-door neighbor, an air traffic controller turned homemaker.--IMDb (TiffBanks) IMCb User Review: 20 November 2009 \/ Jazzie-too \/ A Tender Robert Mitchum: I'm a fan of every Robert Mitchum movie. And then this TV series came along and he played this sentimental role as homeless man, who finds a place in a family of 3 children, without parents, each needing the other to sustain their independence and for the children to not be separated into foster care. I found it to be less comedy and more on family values. Heart-warming situations every week for about the 6 episodes that it ran. I was sad when it ended. But a couple of years ago I searched the web and found a commercial source for the DVD of the entire TV series. Robert Mitchum was so under appreciated for his natural talent. If you look at the body of his work, he could play any type of role. My favorite was \"El Dorado\". \"Promises to Keep\" was a TV movie that showed his softer side. And, yes, he played too many \"B\" movies. But he didn't care. He liked not being poor and making, as he called it, \"easy money\". Did you know he even wrote the story, acted the lead in the movie, and recorded the song \"Thunder Road\"? What a guy!!!","title":"A-Family-For-Joe (1990 *****)"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"a-few-good-men_202105","subject":"Commercial","description":"1990 TV spot trailer for the play A Few Good Men, playing at the Music Box theatre in New York, written by Aaron Sorkin.

Her father, Jim ( Doug Sheehan ), is a workaholic with little time for his daughter and hasn't been able to spend time with her since her mother's death 8 years prior and still seems to be mourning her. Just before the Christmas holiday season, Jessica wins a free wish from a wishing well. Her wish for a mother for Christmas is granted by Philomena ( Doris Roberts ) and Amy Miller ( Olivia Newton-John ), a department store mannequin, is brought to life to be a mom for Jessica. However, there is a catch and Amy can only be a mother to her until Christmas Eve. To clear up any confusion for Jim, Amy claims herself to be a nanny from Australia hired to help care for Jessica while he's at work and she is given a spare room on top of the garage. Amy and Jessica get along until they suffer a brief misunderstanding. Jessica briefly wants to take back the wish and sees Amy go lifeless from her bedroom window. Horrified, she runs out in the rain and stairs to Amy's room, frantically knocking on her door. Amy opens up and Jessica is relieved to see her fine as she is ushered in. The next day, Jessica visits Philomena at the department store to see if she could take back the original wish. She wants Amy to stay forever with them because her father has grown fond of her and she can't bear to lose another mother. Philomena wishes she could help alter the wish, but shows Jessica what Amy will be up against if she isn't there to save her and other the mannequins with faces. The store she works at is planning to replace all the mannequins with faceless ones. Philomena tells Jessica there is only one way to avoid this and if she really wants to save Amy, they must act fast and join hands with her. That isn't the only thing Amy is up against, an inquisitive store detective suspects her of taking a missing Santa mannequin (needed for Jessica's Christmas pageant) from the store and questions her. However, Amy's mannequin friends come to her aid, especially a male mannequin dressed as a driver who warns him to keep his distance from her. Amy and the Santa mannequin both help Jessica overcome her stage fright and put on a convincing performance that wow's the crowd. Jim takes a photograph of Jessica, his first picture of her since her mother died. Christmas Eve and Philomena is late to perform the ritual needed to save Amy so she has to return to the store. Jessica recruits Jim to help save her and they head to the store. By the time they reach the store, they see Amy having gone back to being a mannequin and Jessica throws herself at her. She begs her father to grab Amy's hand and he reluctantly does. The ritual works and Amy is brought back before them. They head for home and Amy's mannequin friends wishes her the best of luck in her new life, while the store detective is awakened by Philomena using her magic feather duster. The film ends with a Christmas picture of Jim, Amy and Jessica.","title":"A Mom For Xmas"},{"date":"1990-10-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"a-nightmare-on-elm-street-video-game-1990","subject":"Emulation for PC","description":"LJN's NES version of the classic horror series casts the player as a teen searching the houses on Elm Street for Freddy Krueger's bones. Once they are all collected, they must be thrown into the high school furnace to destroy Freddy once and for all (a plot similar to 1987's A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors). Nightmare has two worlds. In the red-tinted \"real world,\" players fight snakes and spiders while navigating standard platform challenges. The players here have a \"sleep meter\" that depletes with every hit taken. If the player's sleep meter drops to empty, the game transitions into the blue-tinted \"dream world,\" where enemies take on the appearance of skeletons and ghosts. An invisible timer also starts, counting down until Freddy appears and forces the player into a brief boss battle. The sleep meter becomes a standard life gauge in the dream world, and deducts a life from the player if drained. Players can find and collect three different icons in the dream world to become \"Dream Warriors\" with special powers and projectile attacks - both of which give a significant edge when fighting Freddy. Collecting all the bones in a level takes the player to a final level boss, usually taking the form of a monster with Freddy's face or trademark razor glove. Players move back and forth down Elm Street, and a new house opens up as the previous one is cleared. Nightmare is compatible with the NES Four Score accessory, allowing up to four players to play at once using the same screen.","title":"A Nightmare on Elm Street"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"a-nymphoid-barbarian-in-dinosaur-hell-1990","subject":["Horror","Sci-Fi"],"description":"A Troma Film's Present In a post-Armageddon world, a young woman fights for survival against mutant cave dwellers, dinosaurs, and other prehistoric animals.

The rumours that she had died in a bizarre accident don't deter you; after all, it might just be misdirection. So you track her to the Dark Woods of I\/O Error, where you encounter three hideous beasts and lose your way in the night. Virgil, a Greek poet, meets you in your frenzy and tells you that the only way out is through Hell itself. \"Alas,\" he continues, \"the geography of Hell has changed since last I guided a mortal through it, and you will need assistance besides mine to get through the frozen caves of Cocytus to Paradise.\" \"Who might this assistance come from?\" you wonder aloud. \"Why, from the latest arrival to the Inferno,\" your guide informs you. \"Carmen Santiago.\" Oh well. You've tracked Carmen around the world; through Europe, America, and the reaches of Time. Surely the afterlife won't be much harder! In WHERE IN HELL IS CARMEN SANTIAGO?, you will need to use your detective skills and knowledge of facts from Canticle One of Dante's Commedia: \"Inferno\". Her gang members are here, too, and they bear the punishment that they earned in their lives. Besides that, they bear information on their fellows, as well as useful items to help you in your quest. By talking to them and interpreting their dossiers, you'll figure out where the others are and what items they most desire. Beware! You have only a limited amount of time to find Carmen-- and if you try to find her in the wrong area, you'll be damned for eternity!

The goal of the game is to accumulate 100 million of currency within 10 years. The game is divided into turns, with each turn representing a single month. Main source of money is excavating and selling natural resources (silicon, iron, uranium, food) to merchant ships which arrive every few turns. In order to excavate a resource, the player must first send expeditions of colonists and scientists until a mine is found. Excavating a resource requires the presence of miner robots, human colonists to direct them, and electricity. Electric power is created by generators, which use up some uranium each turn. Building new structures (warehouses, residences for the staff, factories, landing sites for merchant ships) requires spending resources, and takes some electric power too. Once a factory is constructed, the player can produce machines such as robots and generators, though this requires staff, time and electric power as well. Food is gathered from fields; the more colonists are assigned to the fields, the more food is harvested every six months. New staff can be recruited from arriving merchant ships. The players (if there is more than one) can attack each other, but have to build up an army first, consisting of starfighters, battle robots and soldiers. From Mobygames.com.

Once a factory is constructed, the player can produce machines such as robots and generators, though this requires staff, time and electric power as well. Food is gathered from fields; the more colonists are assigned to the fields, the more food is harvested every six months. New staff can be recruited from arriving merchant ships. The players (if there is more than one) can attack each other, but have to build up an army first, consisting of starfighters, battle robots and soldiers. From Mobygames.com.

Each athlete has a few statistics which should be taken into account. During the matches the player can't intervene besides substitutions in the half-time. The player can watch the highlights of the match; either with animations in the 16-bit versions or as text in the 8-bit version. Alternatively only the results can be shown. From Mobygames.com.

It was mid 1990 and San Francisco was an odd place for experimental music. Whether it was free jazz, noise, or ambient, the artists all huddled together, played together and shared their music with one another. It would not be unusual in one night to see four bands perform that shared variations of many of the members across them. This first release captures performances by 4 groups that oddly enough performed alot of shows together during this time. The Molecules, fronted(?) by Ron Anderson, who had recently relocated from NYC, were starting to infect the Bay Area with the chaos only they knew best. These particular pieces featured Steve Buchanan, who at the time was visiting the Bay Area. At the same time Nux Vomica was a brand new group, and was comprised of only Alan Herrick. The sound was much different than what people are familiar with today. The piece recorded for this compilation also featured Jim Cribley of Chemical Toybox. Rounding out the release were experimental music veterans Big City Orchestre as well as a live performance by noize artists Haters","title":"Auricular Audio Magazine #1"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"aamilnehislife0000thwa_i7x6","subject":["Milne, A.

The procedure is implemented by generating a penalty function in a spectral covariance function form. Processing the penalty function causes beam pattern high sidelobes to be penalized and the main lobe to be emphasized. This is accomplished by forming the penalty function in terms of an isotropic noise field of specified strength modified with a finite sector of low coherent energy and stabilized with incoherent sensor noise. By inputting the penalty function into a minimum variance beamformer, the beam pattern and aperture weights are calculated based on the given array geometry. The beamformer used is Capon's Maximum Likelihood Method. The array used to test the procedure is located on sixty degree sector of a cylindrical surface. The procedure is implemented by two different methods, each with some desirable characteristics. One method suppresses sidelobes indirectly by the enhancement of the main lobe with anti-nulls. Both methods are evaluated in terms of a sensitivity factor which constrains the maximum white noise array gain.

Young as she was, Heloise had gained distinction for her accomplishments long before Abelard sought her out and contrived to become her tutor. Their famous correspondence, which poignantly details their passions, began years after their marriage and forced separation, long after Heloise had been coerced into entering a convent and Abelard had become an ascetic monk. Though Abelard's academic brilliance left its mark on the centuries that followed, it is Heloise, her indomitable spirit and infinite compassion for the man she loved, who transcends the ages.

Following training, performance testing of second-order and third-order networks yielded maximum accuracies comparable to those achieved by multilayer perceptron classifiers operating on test data sets. Several versions of an image classification algorithm were tested for learning performance using pixel data from forward-looking infrared (FLIR) images of tanks, trucks, target boards, and clutter. Employing the biologically-motivated Lambertization and contrast normalization of pixel windows, correlations with multiple Gabor function wavelets, and a 'phase synchronizing' local averaging routine, the image classification network extracted data features. Different network versions fed the extracted features to varying output classification schemes. To improve separation of problem classes, recommendations were made for varying the parameters of the Gabor function wavelets and modifying the phase synchronization scheme to extract more suitable features from image pixel data.","title":"A Biologically-Inspired Neural Network Architecture for Image Processing"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"abitibitemiscami0000rous","subject":["Peinture que\u0301be\u0301coise","Peinture moderne -- 20e sie\u0300cle -- Que\u0301bec (Province)","Abitibi-Te\u0301miscamingue (Que\u0301bec) dans l'art"],"description":["112 pages : 28 cm","Oeuvres de 24 artistes-peintres de cette re\u0301gion, illustrant cette me\u0302me re\u0301gion"],"title":"Abitibi-Te\u0301miscamingue en peinture = Abitibi-Te\u0301miscamingue in painting"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"abjectionmelanch0000unse","subject":["Kristeva, Julia, 1941-","Psychoanalysis and literature","Feminism and literature -- France"],"description":["ix, 213 p. ; 23 cm","Most of the papers were presented at a conference held at the University of Warwick in May 1987","Includes bibliographies and index"],"title":"Abjection, melancholia, and love : the work of Julia Kristeva"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"ablateralhydropo01unit","subject":["Uncompahgre Valley Reclamation Project (U.S.)","Hydroelectric power plants","Environmental impact analysis"],"description":["Cover title: Uncompahgre Valley Reclamation Project : AB lateral hydropower facility : final environmental impact statement","Vol. 2 distributed to depository libraries in microfiche","\"AUG 28 1990\"--Stamped on title page","Includes bibliographical references (pages 291-304)","v. 2.

A material for this purpose has been developed that uses silicon dioxide (fused quartz) in a fibrous packed matrix, forming blocks which can behave as a glassy ablator on the surface when subject to very high surface heat fluxes. These fibrous silicon dioxide blocks are called Reusable Surface Insulation (RSI). The primary constituent of the RSI material is silicon dioxide, but may contain other compounds (e.g. alumina borosilicate) to affect the thermal and physical properties. The research performed in this thesis is to determine the ablative behavior of ceramic RSI materials in a hypersonic high enthalpy flow that is used to simulate entry into Earth atmosphere. Actual arc jet experiments were performed to measure mass loss, melt run off, and fiber collapse of these materials and compare the experimental results with predicted theoretical values. The tests were performed to ascertain if RSI type materials could be used for entry vehicles proposed in NASA Mars missions.","title":"Ablative heat shield studies for NASA Mars\/Earth return entry vehicles"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"ablebakercharlie0000vaug","subject":"Short stories in English American writers 1945- Texts","description":"[224]p. ;

The field research was conducted from 15 June to 10 September, 1989. Bats were captured in mist nets set over ponds, streams, and springs and at the entrance of two caves. Numbers of bats captured were greatest at Little Ice Cave and at Mystery Cave. Capture success was considerably lower at water sources, but a greater diversity of species were captured at these sites, particularly at Sage Creek campground and Gyp Spring. Most of the species captured occurred throughout the area, with the exception of the pallid bat, Antrozous pallidus, and the silver-haired bat, Lasionycteris noctivagans, which were more restricted in distribution. Eight individuals of Antrozous pallidus were captured at Gyp Spring. This species was known previously in Montana from only one specimen taken at Gyp spring (Shryer and Flath, 1980). Of the eight individual pallid bats netted in 1989, four were lactating females, indicating that this species breeds in Montana. Several of the species of bats found in the Pryor Mountains were captured in numbers significantly different from an expected 1:1 sex ration. This was especially true at Mystery Cave and Little Ice Cave, suggesting that in some species, male and females may be differentially utilizing habitat.

The instrument was launched aboard a NASA sounding rocket on March 30, 1990. Post- flight tests indicated that the calibration did not change as a result of the rocket experiment. Ultraviolet dayglow spectra of the Earth's ionosphere were obtained from approximately 100 km to 320 km in altitude over a wavelength range of 1800 A to 3400 A. The spectra were divided into 512 pixels of approximately 3.134 A per pixel. Analyses of the data from 2420 A to 2490 A and from 2920 A to 2972 A were conducted to obtain the intensity profiles of the OII 2470.4 A multiplet and the OI 2972.3 A line emission, respectively. The intensity profile of the OII 2470.4 A multiplet was found to have a broad peak of 1.6 kR centered at approximately 250 km. The intensity profile of the OI 2972.3 A line emission shows a general trend of decreasing intensity with altitude. The maximum intensity of 3.6 kR was found at 105 km and the minimum of 137 R at 315 km. A partial layer, with an intensity of 4.1 kR, was evident near 150 km.","title":"A calibration of the Naval Postgraduate School Middle Ultraviolet Spectrograph and an analysis of the OII 2470 \u00ce\u00a9A and OI 2972 \u00ce\u00a9A emissions obtained from mid-latitude rocket observations"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"acapellachristma0000greg","title":"an acapella christmas"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"acapracticerevis0000unse","title":"ACA practice and revision kit. 2.5B, Organisation and management"},{"date":"1990-06-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"acaptionbasednat1094530639","subject":["Natural language processing (Computer science)","Natural language processing","multimedia database system","natural language interface","descriptive captions"],"description":"This research examined the grammar structure of descriptive English captions on multimedia data. The research was composed of three phases. The first phase was to investigate the grammar structure of example descriptive captions from a variety of subject domains. The second phase was to develop a set of domain independent binary grammar rules to be used in the Caption-Based Interface (CBI) which is a natural language interface for the Multimedia Database System. The third phase of the research was to implement and test the grammar rules in the CBI. The program was implemented in C-prolog on a Sun SPARC workstation. The testing phase also includes timing and memory comparisons between C-Prolog an interpretive programming language and a compiled version of the code using Quintus Prolog. This thesis was able to show that the grammar rules that were developed could correctly identify their intended structures. Another accomplishment of this thesis was to demonstrate that the CBI could parse 25 out of 30 example captions and that it could correctly handle some semantic interpretations of the parsed captions.","title":"A caption-based natural-language interface handling descriptive captions for a multimedia database system"},{"date":"1990-09-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"acarrierdeployme1094534942","subject":["Operations research","Modeling","Carrier","Optimization","Deployment Model"],"description":"Aircraft carriers are and will continue to be highly important to the United States as she safeguards her interests globally. Today's budget environment, however, demands efficient use of these carrier assets in meeting their station coverage assignments. In a peacetime environment, a carrier's ability to cover a station is constrained by depot maintenance, training cycles, and the Chief of Naval Operations personnel and operating tempo program (PERSTEMPO OPTEMPO). To aid in satisfying this demand on carriers, a mixed integer programming model is developed. The output from the model provides optimal station coverage assignments for a given level of coverage under constraints associated with carrier operations. When implemented in conjunction with the General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS), the model requires minimal user inputs and is implementable on a personal computer. Other applications of the model are also demonstrated in several examples.","title":"A carrier deployment model"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"acatos1990cerami0000unse","title":"Acatos 1990 : ceramics and glass international auction records"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"acblackcolourboo0000inma","subject":["Adam and Charles Black (Firm)","Adam and Charles Black (Firm) -- Bibliography","Adam and Charles Black (Firm) -- Catalogs","Book industries and trade -- Great Britain","Color printing","Book industries and trade","Great Britain","Antiquarian books"],"description":["xi, 307 pages, [10] leaves of color plates : 23 cm","Sample bookmark based on ones found in A & C Black books laid-in","Includes biographies of authors and artists","Includes index"],"title":"The A & C Black colour books : a collector's guide and bibliography 1900-1930"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"acc.-no.-39256-brahmananda-keerthanaikal-1990","subject":["\u0bb5\u0bc7\u0ba4\u0bbe\u0ba8\u0bcd\u0ba4 \u0b9a\u0bbe\u0bb0\u0bae\u0bc6\u0ba9\u0bcd\u0ba9\u0bc1\u0bae\u0bcd \u0baa\u0bbf\u0bb0\u0bae\u0bbe\u0ba9\u0ba8\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0b95\u0bcd \u0b95\u0bc0\u0bb0\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0ba9\u0bc8\u0b95\u0bb3\u0bcd","\u0bb6\u0bcd\u0bb0\u0bc0\u0bae\u0ba4\u0bcd\u0bb6\u0bcd\u0bb0\u0bc0 \u0bb5\u0bbf\u0bb5\u0bc7\u0b95\u0bbe\u0ba9\u0ba8\u0bcd\u0ba4 \u0bb8\u0bcd\u0bb5\u0bbe\u0bae\u0bbf\u0b95\u0bb3\u0bc1\u0bae\u0bcd \u0b9a\u0bbf\u0bb7\u0bcd\u0baf\u0bb0\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bb3\u0bc1\u0bae\u0bcd"],"description":"\u0bb5\u0bc7\u0ba4\u0bbe\u0ba8\u0bcd\u0ba4 \u0b9a\u0bbe\u0bb0\u0bae\u0bc6\u0ba9\u0bcd\u0ba9\u0bc1\u0bae\u0bcd \u0baa\u0bbf\u0bb0\u0bae\u0bbe\u0ba9\u0ba8\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0b95\u0bcd \u0b95\u0bc0\u0bb0\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0ba9\u0bc8\u0b95\u0bb3\u0bcd , \u0bb6\u0bcd\u0bb0\u0bc0\u0bae\u0ba4\u0bcd\u0bb6\u0bcd\u0bb0\u0bc0 \u0bb5\u0bbf\u0bb5\u0bc7\u0b95\u0bbe\u0ba9\u0ba8\u0bcd\u0ba4 \u0bb8\u0bcd\u0bb5\u0bbe\u0bae\u0bbf\u0b95\u0bb3\u0bc1\u0bae\u0bcd \u0b9a\u0bbf\u0bb7\u0bcd\u0baf\u0bb0\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bb3\u0bc1\u0bae\u0bcd, \u0bae\u0ba4\u0bc1\u0bb0\u0bc8 \u0bb8\u0bbe\u0ba4\u0bc1 \u0bb8\u0bc7\u0bb5\u0bbe \u0bb8\u0bae\u0bbe\u0b9c\u0bae\u0bcd \u0bb6\u0bcd\u0bb0\u0bc0 \u0bb5\u0bbf\u0bb5\u0bc7\u0b95\u0bbe\u0ba9\u0ba8\u0bcd\u0ba4 \u0bb8\u0bcd\u0bb5\u0bbe\u0bae\u0bbf\u0b95\u0bb3\u0bcd \u0bae\u0b9f\u0bbe\u0bb2\u0baf\u0bae\u0bcd, 76, \u0ba4\u0bbf\u0bb0\u0bc1\u0baa\u0bcd\u0baa\u0bb0\u0b99\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bc1\u0ba9\u0bcd\u0bb1\u0bae\u0bcd \u0bb0\u0bcb\u0b9f\u0bc1, \u0bae\u0ba4\u0bc1\u0bb0\u0bc8 -

During the first stage of the experiment, nine data sets were obtained with rainfall rates up to 300 mm\/hr. The characteristic fifteen kilohertz peak in the underwater sound spectrum generated by small raindrops in light rain is absent during heavy rain. These data sets show a good correlation between rainfall rate and underwater sound levels, suggesting that acoustical measurement of rainfall rate at sea is possible. The correlation is best at lower frequencies (2-10 kHz). At higher frequencies (12-22 kI-Iz) low spectral levels are observed in conditions of high wind (> 10 ns), presumably due to sound absorption by ambient bubble clouds from breaking waves. At very high rainfall rates (>200 mm\/hr), low levels at higher frequencies are also observed suggesting that the rain itself is capable of producing large populations of bubbles which absorb the sound radiated from the surface.","title":"A characterization of underwater sound produced by heavy precipitation"},{"date":"1990-09-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"achemicalcasualt1094534947","subject":["Mathematical models","Chemical warfare.","Chemical Casualties","Chemical Warfare","Regression","CHEMCAS"],"description":"Currently, to plan chemical weapons' use on the battlefield, planners use the classified chemical weapon effects tables contained in FM 3-10B and look up the expected casualties based on the meteorological and target conditions. This can be a lengthy and time-consuming process especially when many weapons are available andor many targets are under consideration. Mathematical models could significantly improve both the speed and accuracy of the current procedure and thus allow chemical weapons to be exercised more frequently. This thesis develops a model for one chemical agent and delivery system. A large simulation experiment was conducted to gather the expected number of casualties for each combination of meteorological and target conditions. The results were then fit to one model through multivariate regression to provide one equation that models the expected number of casualties from this one agent. Future work could easily expand on this effort to include other agents and weapon systems.","title":"A chemical casualty model"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"achievementaspir0000unse","subject":["Education, Secondary -- Curricula -- Ireland","Education, Secondary -- Curricula -- Ireland -- Evaluation","Curriculum planning -- Ireland -- History"],"description":["xii, 147 p. ; 21 cm","Includes bibliographical references"],"title":"Achievement and aspiration : curricular initiatives in Irish post-primary education in the 1980s"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"achievementofjoh00itke","description":"Includes bibliographical references (p. 201-204) and index","title":"The achievement of John Henry Newman"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"achievementtestg00albe_0","subject":"Science","description":["Cover title","41"],"title":"Achievement test.

The decision aid was developed as a module inside the Condensed Army Mobility Management Model (CAMMS). The decision aid selects tactical route based upon a complex methodology which considers a number of variables in the tactical situation and the time available. The Janus(A) high resolution combat model was chosen to compare the routes selected by the decision aid against routes selected by active duty officers in two different areas of operation. A measure of effectiveness was selected based on the casualty figures generated by the Janus(A) model. When compared against the officer routes using the MOE, decision aid routes were more effective in one of the two areas of operation. Janus(A) was also used to determine if routes the decision aid deemed as better were more effective as measured by the MOE. The study found that some of the better routes were actually less effective in Janus(A).

The Joint Theater Level Simulation, a computer combat simulation model, is used as a tool for analysis to compare the three strategies in a Fulda Gap scenario against a variety of Soviet attack options. The JTLS model is used because of its ability to simulate large forces and also to demonstrate the value of JTLS as an analytical tool, in addition to a training and evaluation tool. Using the following measures of effectiveness: Soviet airplanes shot down by US ADA, percentage of successful Soviet bombing missions, and number of US ground- targets destroyed, the forward concentration defense proves to have a significant advantage over the other two strategies, regardless of the weighting of the measures of effectiveness.","title":"A comparative analysis of U.

The field strength values predicted by IONCAP-PC 2.5 are extended to take into consideration the specific antenna designs and predicted noise levels are also calculated for the environments involved. The resulting signal-to-noise ratio is compared with the observed signal-to-noise ratio and a statistical analysis is performed on the resulting errors.

This is currently provided by the Navy's PIPS model which is based on Hibler's (1979) sea ice model which combines the thermodynamic ice heat budget with a dynamic ice model sensitive to the effects of ice thickness and ice strength. The PIPS model simultaneously solves a system of four equations of ice momentum balance, ice rheology, ice thickness, and ice strength. In order to test the performance of Hibler's formulation, another version of it, developed by Lemke et al., (1990), was adapted to the Arctic Ocean. The model was initialized and run using 1986 forcing data and its performance evaluated using Arctic buoy drift data. Results indicate that the model ice drift is principally driven by wind forcing, that its response to changes in weather is rapid and essentially correct, and that it performs better at high wind speeds than at low wind speeds. Limitations to its accuracy were chiefly the result of limits to the precision and resolution of the input data provided to run the model, especially near the ice margins. Overall, the model performs well in depicting the ice flow pattern in all conditions in the Arctic.","title":"A comparison of ice drift motion from modeled and buoy data"},{"date":"1990-12-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"acomparisonofmar1094527681","subject":["Cost","Training"],"description":"This thesis calculates and compares the marginal cost of graduating a naval officer from the United States Naval Academy (USNA), Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps (NROTC), and Officer Candidate School (OCS).

Numerical predictions were obtained for a wide range of Rayleigh and Prandtl numbers, substrate to fluid and heat source to fluid thermal conductivity ratios and other geometrical parameters that may be encountered in practice. An increase in Rayleigh number lead to more vigorous flow and promoted cooling. No noticeable effect on the nondimensional temperature was observed when changing the Prandt number from 7 to 100. Little reduction in maximum temperatures was observed when substrate and component to fluid thermal conductivity ratios were increased beyond 10 and 25, respectively. Component to substrate width ratio change from .25 to .999 resulted in approximately linear decrease in the maximum temperature.

The DPRK has committed over 10% of its GNP since 1963 to defense expenditures, whereas, the ROK has spent a relatively small portion (3-6%) of GNP over the same period. Because the U.S. plans to withdraw from the ROK in the near future, a heavy burden will be imposed upon the South Korean government to maintain its national defense. The U.S. withdrawal will result in the delay of achieving a military balance in the Korean Peninsula. Under these conditions, it becomes essential to find the most efficient allocation of the defense budget so as to get the most high-tech weapons, and achieve military balance with the DPRK at the soonest possible time. The purpose of this thesis is to compute the service levels for critical items with the present budget and to determine whether the budget is used effectively in the ROK Army. Cost analysis methods are used to solve the problem. An application of this methodology is shown with an illustration. This analysis shows that different items call for different service levels.","title":"A cost analysis for deciding service levels in Korean Army with a constraint for single period"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"acousticaldesign0000acou","subject":["Architectural acoustics -- Congresses","Music facilities -- Congresses","Conservatories of music -- Congresses"],"description":["244 p. : 28 cm","Includes bibliographical references (p. 222-225) and index"],"title":"Acoustical design of music education facilities : essays concerning the acoustical design of music education facilities and reproductions of posters describing fifty recent projects presented at special poster and lecutre sessions entitled \"Music Education Facilities since 1975\" during the 117th Meeting of the Acoustical Society of America in Syracuse, New York, 25 May 1989"},{"date":"1990-12-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"acousticemission1094527673","subject":["Engineering","Science","Aluminum","Fatigue.","aircraft fatigue","aging aircraft","crack growth","7075 alumiunum","spectrum loading","acoustic emission","plate waves"],"description":"The E-2C Hawkeye, a U.S. Navy aircraft, has experienced problems with fatigue cracks in its wings. This problem was studied in the laboratory using a representative specimen under simulated flight loading. Acoustic emission monitoring was used to detect the stress pulses emitted during cracking. A new wave analysis technique was applied in order to distinguish extraneous noise from crack growth. This technique distinguishes between the extensional and flexural waves in thin aluminum plates. Extensional waves were found to correlate experimentally with waves from crack growth, while noise sources show different waveforms with lower frequencies. It was shown that acoustic emission provided early (crack length less than 0.01 inch) detection of fatigue cracking. This show promise for use in monitoring aircraft fatigue life.","title":"Acoustic emission from spectrum fatigue cracks in 7075 aluminum"},{"date":"1990-06-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"acousticinteract00scan","subject":["ELASTIC SHELLS.","SHELLS(STRUCTURAL FORMS).","SONAR ARRAYS."],"description":["Cover title","\"NPS-53-90-009.\"","\"June 1990.\"","AD A226 091","Includes bibliographical references (p. 9-10)","The acoustical performance of a submerged linear array of spherical transducers is examined by combining the T-Matrix method of solving for multiple acoustic interactions among separate bodies with a model for the transducers as thin spherical elastic shells.

The transmission test was conducted in the Monterey Bay where the signals propagated from deep water to shallow, continental shelf water. In order to use the inverse techniques to infer the ocean processes affecting the acoustic propagation, the propagation paths of the tomographic signal between the transmitter and receivers must be determined. This thesis demonstrates that the forward problem of arrival path identification in the complex propagation environment of the Monterey Bay can be solved by using high resolution bottom bathymetry along with an appropriate sound speed profile as input to a three dimensional Hamiltonian raytracing program, HARPO. The eigenrays found using this technique matched the travel times and relative amplitudes of the measured multipath arrivals.","title":"Acoustic modeling of the Monterey Bay tomography experiment"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"acousticsofcrime0000holl","subject":["Criminal investigation","Forensic phonetics","Forensic acoustics"],"description":["xiv, 370 p. : 26 cm","Includes bibliographical references and index"],"title":"The acoustics of crime : the new science of forensic phonetics"},{"date":"1990-06-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"acoustictomograp1094530631","description":"In a computer simulation experiment, acoustic tomography is assessed as a means of measuring the seasonal flux of heat advected by the Norwegian Atlantic Current. Oceanic heat flux has traditionally been measured by various direct or indirect techniques that are prone to error or large uncertainty. The tomographic technique offers distinct advantages over conventional methods in that temperature and current fields, that combine to yield heat flux in the ocean, can be determined at various spatial and temporal scales. The adequacy of the tomographic technique thus hinges on the question of how well can the temperature and current by resolved spatially? The spatial resolution of tomography varies with array size, number of transceivers used and the characteristics of the sound channel. In the assessment we use the General Digital Environmental Model (GDEM), a climatological data base, to simulate an ocean area 550 x 550 km squared off the Norwegian Coast. Resolution and variance analysis are performed on two circular arrays consisting of six transceivers. An important finding is that the horizontal resolution lengths of the current and temperature fields differ. For a six element array the horizontal resolution length is approximately one fifth the array diameter for the current field, whereas for the temperature field it is one sixth the array diameter. We then generate synthetic travel time data that have embedded within them temperature and current signals as well as random noise. We invert the synthetic travel time data to form estimates of the original fields using a linear optimal estimator based on the Gauss-Markoff theorem. We relate the sound speed perturbation field to potential temperature and compare these estimates to the original values. Finally we use the estimated fields to compute heat flux across a transect located within the array. We compare the actual to the estimated heat flux to asses the quality of the tomographically derived value. We have found that the quality of the heat flux estimates depends critically on how well the flow field is resolved. A six element array can adequately resolve the current in the Norwegian Sea, provided that its diameter is shorter than 250 km. Such an array is able to measure net heat flux through a transect at the center of the array with only a 10% error.","title":"Acoustic tomographic estimate of ocean advective heat flux [electronic resource] : a numerical assessment in the Norwegian Sea"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"acoustoopticsapp0000spri","subject":"Acoustooptics -- Congresses","description":["x, 457 p. : 23 cm","Includes bibliographical references and index"],"title":"Acoustooptics and applications : 4th spring school, 23-27 May 1989, Gdan\u0301sk, Sobieszewo"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"acpowercondition0000clar","subject":["Electric power supplies to apparatus","Electric apparatus and appliances -- Protection"],"description":["x, 208 p. : 26 cm","Includes index"],"title":"AC power conditioners : design and applications"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"acpowerlinefilte00unse","title":"AC Power Line Filters for Printed Circuit Board Application"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"acquiredneurolog0000unse","subject":["Speech disorders in children","Language Disorders -- etiology","Language Disorders","Infant","Child","Nervous System Diseases -- complications","Nervous System Diseases","Speech Disorders -- etiology","Speech Disorders","Parole, Troubles de la, chez l'enfant","Langage, Troubles du, chez l'enfant","MEDICAL -- Pediatrics","HEALTH & FITNESS -- Children's Health"],"description":["1 online resource (347 pages) :","The long-held belief that acquired aphasia in children is primarily of the non-fluent type has been challenged in recent years.

An acquisition group decision support system (AGDSS), defined in this thesis, seeks to maintain acquisition team integrity and provides the necessary information processing capacity to mitigate the impact of these effects. The combination of such key technologies as local area networks, word processing, graphics, data base management, and video conferencing, is employed, which can free acquisition team members of mundane paperwork and afford them extraordinary decision making capabilities. These capabilities promise to result in more timely and better informed decisions. An example is provided to illustrate the application of an AGDSS to an acquisition-related problem and to show the benefits that can be derived from the output of the AGDSS. Finally, a system-level specification describing the performance and interface requirements is presented.","title":"Acquisition group decision support system"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"acquittalofgodth0000siem","subject":["Bonhoeffer, Dietrich, 1906-1945","Vietnam War (1961-1975)","Vietnam War, 1961-1975 -- Veterans -- United States","Veterans -- Religious life -- United States","Suffering -- Religious aspects -- Christianity","Veterans","Veterans -- Religious life","Religio\u0098ses Erleben","Veteran","Vietnamkrieg","United States"],"description":["107 pages ; 21 cm","Includes bibliographical references (pages 97-107)"],"title":"The acquittal of God : a theology for Vietnam veterans"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"acronymsabbrevia0000wend","subject":["Molecular spectroscopy -- Acronyms","Molecular spectroscopy -- Abbreviations","Molecular spectroscopy -- Dictionaries","Spectroscopie","Physique nucle\u0301aire","Abre\u0301viations","Dictionnaires","Molecular spectroscopy","Moleculaire spectrometrie","Spectroscopie mole\u0301culaire -- abre\u0301viations","Spectroscopie mole\u0301culaire -- dictionnaires","Spectroscopie mole\u0301culaire -- sigles","Moleku\u0308lspektroskopie","Akronym","Abku\u0308rzung","Spectrum Analysis -- abbreviations","Spectrum Analysis -- acronyms","Spectrum Analysis -- dictionaries"],"description":["315 pages : 25 cm","Includes bibliographical references and index"],"title":"Acronyms and abbreviations in molecular spectroscopy : an enzyclopedic dictionary"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"acronymsinitiali0001unse_g6d8","subject":["Acronyms","Abbreviations","Dictionnaires comme sujet -- Terminologie comme sujet","Vocabulaire -- Terminologie comme sujet"],"description":["3 volumes ; 29 cm","\"Covering: aerospace, associations, banking, biochemistry, business, data processing, domestic and international affairs, economics, education, electronics, genetics, government, information technology, investment, labor, law, medicine, military affairs, periodicals, pharmacy, physiology, politics, religion, science, societies, sports, technical drawings and specifications, telecommunications, trade, transportation, and other fields.\"","V.1 pt. 1.

Renckens Kritiek op het onderzoek van alternatieve geneeswijzen en diagnostische methoden. De geneeskunde is een samenhangend kennisgebied en wat niet klopt met de basiskennis kan niet serieus genomen worden. Verder moet een geneeskundige behandeling met een goede diagnose beginnen. Die ontbreekt ook bij de alternatieven. Alternatieve opleidingen binnen medische faculteit? Nederlandse universiteiten: let op uw saeck! H. Timmerman Lees mee met drs. A.L. Ternee Koeterwaals\u00a0 Henriette van Schagen, arts voor homeopathie en acupunctuur te Haarlem, zegt in een voorlichtingsfolder van het ziekenfonds: 'Bij ernstige hoofdpijnklachten is er vaak sprake van een storing in de energie van de lever- of galblaasmeridiaan. Met acupunctuur kun je daar invloed op uitoefenen. Meestal merk je na twee of drie behandelingen al enig resultaat, maar bij hardnekkige klachten moet je toch een keer of acht terugkomen.'

Combat availability is defined as the number of active combatant platforms being supported by a single fault diagnosis and repair facility. Heavy traffic conditions inherent to intense combat periods allow the use of diffusion approximation models, which provide speedy solutions used to compare adaptive scheduling policies to a standard First-Come, First-Serve policy. The adequacy of these models is investigated and numerical solutions are compared to simulation results. The case in which failed modules require a degree of support that is beyond the capability of local maintenance is also investigated for both pre- and post-local-repair relocation to distant repair. The use of cannibalization in short-term situations is shown to have a dramatic effect in terms of combat availability. A preliminary model for a non-cannibalization policy is also developed. Optimization models for choosing spare parts allocation within budget constraints, or for achieving required operational availability with minimum cost are described","Brazilian Navy author","MAW 12\/29\/2009"],"title":"Adaptive logistics support for combat"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"adaptivelogistic00silvpdf","subject":"Operations research,Military art and science","description":"Thesis Advisor(s): Gaver, Donald P. ; Second Reader: Gragg, William B","title":"Adaptive logistics support for combat"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"adaptivelogistic1094527932","subject":["Operations research","Diffusion Approximation, Combat Logistics, Cannibalization, Availability."],"description":"DTIC Descriptors: Adaptive Systems, Allocations, Availability, Combat Support, Costs, Diagnosis(General), Diffusion, Faults, Intensity, Logistics Support, Maintenance, Models, Numerical Analysis, Optimization, Platforms, Policies, Repair Shops, Scheduling, Short Range(Time), Simulation, Solutions(General), Spare Parts, Traffic, Transients, Warfare, Weapon Systems","title":"Adaptive logistics support for combat"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"adaptiveneuralne0000burn","subject":["Cerebral cortex","Neural networks (Neurobiology)"],"description":["vii, 367 p. : 24 cm","Includes bibliographical references (p.

Based on the requirement analysis and prototypes performed by previous work, this thesis develops and implements a personal computer-based Management Information System for the Management of the many funding accounts controlled by the Administrative Sciences Department. The central objective was to integrate accounting transactions performed in several different offices, currently using different software programs, into a single all-encompassing Management Information System.

The major feature in the region during the cruise period was a strong meandering jet which flowed equatorward and offshore, oriented in a northeast to southwest direction.

The measured (ADCP) currents showed more details of the flow at deeper depths than the model, which showed a broader baroclinic flow at depth and a level of no motion near 300 m. The maximum surface velocities from model and ADCP cross-sections agreed to within 10 cm\/sec except for leg G, in which ADCP velocity was greater than the model velocity by about 30 cm\/sec. The sign of vertical velocity agrees very well with independent estimates made from bio-optical data; however, the magnitude calculated by the model is 30 to 60 times larger than that estimated from the bio-optical observations.","title":"A diagnostic study of the velocity structure of a meandering jet using a primitive equation model with dynamic mode initialization"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"adiclientbasesurunse","description":"USA","title":"ADI-Client Base Survey"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"adictionaryengl00jamegoog","subject":["Johnson, Samuel, 1709-1784.

The formulation is based on Galerkin's method, using Green's function applied in the Fourier transform domain. The impedance (Z sub 0) has been calculated by using a variational method. The propagation constant (betaomega) and effective dielectric constant of the SCPL have been calculated by using a method of moments. The cut-off frequency of this wave guide has been obtained by a theorem of Van Bladel and Higgins.","title":"A discontinuity study in shielded coplanar line"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"adjustingtosucce0000bala","subject":["Balance of payments -- Hong Kong","Balance of payments -- Korea (South)","Balance of payments -- Singapore","Balance of payments -- Taiwan"],"description":["xiii, 137 p. : 23 cm","\"April 1990.\"","Includes bibliographical references (p. 135-137)"],"title":"Adjusting to success : balance of payments policy in the East Asian NICs"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"adjuvanttherapyo0000inte","subject":["Cancer -- Adjuvant treatment -- Congresses","Cancer -- Adjuvant treatment","Krebs Medizin","Adjuvante Therapie","Kongress","Adjuvants, Immunologic","Adjuvants, Pharmaceutic","Neoplasms -- drug therapy","Humans Cancer Drug therapy"],"description":["xxxviii, 629 pages : 24 cm","Includes bibliographical references"],"title":"Adjuvant therapy of cancer VI : proceedings of the Sixth International Conference on the Adjuvant Therapy of Cancer, Tucson, Arizona, March 7-10, 1990"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"adlaartd00artd","title":"ADLA"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"adlasix0000artd","subject":["Graphic arts -- United States","Commercial art -- United States"],"description":["[244] p. : 31cm","Includes index"],"title":"ADLA Six"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"adler-mortimer-como-leer-un-libro_202010","subject":"Aprende","description":"Leer","title":"Adler Mortimer Como Leer Un Libro"},{"date":"1990-09-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"adlibjukebox16","subject":["Floppy Dumps","AdLib","DOS Applications","Music","BitHistory.org Archive","BitHistory.org Software Collection","Kernel86"],"description":"AdLib Juke Box v1.6 (Ad Lib, Inc.)(1987) dumped: 2009-10-12 sha1sum: a66cd8ff967352c1f8b7fe1831fb6e3143620fe6","title":"AdLib Juke Box v1.6"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"administeringdan0000tuck","subject":["Industrial safety -- Law and legislation -- Ontario -- History","Industrial hygiene -- Law and legislation -- Ontario -- History","Factory laws and legislation -- Ontario -- History"],"description":["x, 310 p. ; 24 cm","Includes bibliographical references and index"],"title":"Administering danger in the workplace : the law and politics of occupational health and safety regulation in Ontario, 1850-1914"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"administracionpu0000unse","subject":["Finance -- Latin America","Finance -- North America","Latin America -- Economic conditions -- 1982-","Latin America -- Economic policy","Latin America -- Politics and government -- 1980-","Latin America -- Foreign economic relations -- North America","North America -- Foreign economic relations -- Latin America"],"description":["2 v. : 21 cm","\"1988-1989.\"","Includes bibliographical references"],"title":"Administracio\u0301n pu\u0301blica, economi\u0301a y finanzas : problemas actuales en los pai\u0301ses de Norteame\u0301rica y el Caribe = Public administration, economics and finance : current issues in the North American and Caribbean countries"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"administrationma00stoj","subject":"Criminal justice, Administration of","description":"Includes bibliographical references","title":"The administration and management of criminal justice organizations : a book of readings"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"administrativeca0000unse","subject":["College administrators -- United States -- Selection and appointment","Universities and colleges -- United States -- Administration","College presidents -- United States","College administrators -- United States"],"description":["118 p. ; 23 cm","Includes bibliographies and index"],"title":"Administrative careers and the marketplace"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"administrativedi00unit","subject":["Dispute resolution (Law)","Administrative procedure","Conflict management","Dispute resolution (Law) -- United States","Administrative procedure -- United States","Conflict management -- United States"],"description":["CMS copy in folder: Public Laws: 101st Congress \/ Public Laws \/ 1989 & 1990","Cover title","Shipping list no.: 91-089-P","\"Nov. 15, 1990, (H.R. 2497)\"--P.

The ASE project updates a study conducted in 1954--the most recent national survey on this topic--through the presentation of data about the range of services and the compilation of bibliographic essays on key services. The narrative report, which covers the problem to be studied and activities undertaken in each of the three phases of the project, is supplemented by 11 exhibits. These exhibits make up nearly three quarters of this document: (1) a 1982 ALA goal award proposal submitted by the Adult Services Committee of the Reference and Adult Services Division (RASD); (2) correspondence about attendance at the ASE Assembly and a short questionnaire; (3) the first draft of the final questionnaire; (4) a booklet of library terminology which accompanied the 1954 survey and instructions for updating the booklet; (5) the second draft of the questionnaire; (6) the pretest of the final survey tool; (7) the cover letter and the final version of the questionnaire; (8) a short essay summarizing ASE project goals; (9) a memo about data entry; (10) a reminder note to respond to the survey; and (11) printouts of the data entry, data check, cleanup, and state append computer programs.

It\u2019s an ornament.\u00a0 Don\u2019t poke. You must take. And this one\u2026very soft. Sometimes the composer writes it wrong (ornament), but he never plays it wrong. He plays it this way. Listen to your tape. Paderewski is playing it this way.\u00a0 I\u2019ve asked a famous concert pianist about this problem. She said the composer never plays it wrong, never. It\u2019s his composition, so he never plays it wrong.\u00a0 Play that part again. It says that in the score. It\u2019s okay anyway. Very important sound.\u00a0 One more.\u00a0 Don\u2019t shake.

The volume includes revised versions of nearly all the contributions presented at the conference, including shortened versions of the talks given at the special rump session for recent results. Recent outbreaks of viruses, worms and computer fraud together with progress in telecommunications, computer networks and automated banking have considerably increased the interest in data security techniques, where cryptography is generaly considered to be the most important tool. In this area of data security, where high stakes are at risk, up-to-date information is crucial. This book is organized into sections on public-key cryptosystems, theory, zero-knowledge protocols, applications, signature and untraceability, cryptanalysis, sharing and authentication schemes, sequences, algorithms, old problems, and impromptu talks.\"--Publisher's website","Includes bibliographical references and index","Section 1.

Friend and Woodward describe these adaptations and discuss the degree to which they are genetically determined or merely the product of physiological plasticity.**Thomas presents a modular concept of ecology in which modules contain a resource and its associated consumers, and goes on to examine the general principles which may reflect the various mutualisms between organisms in some example fresh water modular systems.**Finally, West examines the microphytic soil crusts of arid and semi-arid soils.

The game is a side scroller, Master Higgins moves across the screen from left to right and finds his power-ups in giant eggs. This includes a skateboard which results in a great speed enhancement - until Master Higgins gets hit and loses his power. If he is not on a skateboard a hit means instant death. Another game mechanic is starvation which gets indicated through a meter which steadily decreases. If it hits zero the hero dies and the only way to fill it up is by collecting food on the way.

The instantaneous pressure distribution and flow velocity were measured simultaneously. Pressure information was integrated numerically to determine instantaneous values for lift, drag and moment about the quarter chord. The results were plotted as three-dimensional surface plots in angle of attack, cycle time and performance coefficient axes, or with chordwise position, cycle time and pressure coefficient axes, as appropriate. The pressure distribution over the airfoil was shown to be primarily a function of freestream static pressure. Aerodynamic coefficients as a function of angle of attack and time exhibited seemingly random, erratic behavior, whereas the mean values of the same coefficients were similar in nature to those obtained in steady flow. The data indicate that the instantaneous performance of an airfoil in an oscillating flow is not merely a continuum of many quasi-steady states.","title":"Aerodynamic coefficients of a symmetrical airfoil in an oscillating flow"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"aerofilmsbookofi0000unse","description":["160p. : 26x27 cm","Includes index"],"title":"The aerofilms book of Ireland from the air"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"aeromodellershan0000neth","subject":["Airplanes -- Models","Flying model aeroplanes"],"description":"217 pages","title":"Aeromodellers' handbook"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"aeronautics_space_report_254","subject":"NASA","description":"Future Energy Source This video describes the efforts of the Center for the Commercial Development of Space in Wisconsin to develop a strategy for mining Helium-3, an efficient, environmentally safe alternative to fossil fuels that exists on the moon.

Global Greenhouse Expedition This video covers an airborne study of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. LDEF Update This video explores the research being done on the Long Duration Exposure Facility (LDEF), a satellite carrying 57 experiments designed to study the effects of the space environment, which had been in orbit for almost 6 years, and was retrieved and brought back to Earth by the Space Shuttle Astronauts. The video shows scenes of the retrieval of LDEF, as well as scenes of ongoing research into the data returned with the satellite from experiments on external coating, contamination of optical materials by thermal control paint, the effects of cosmic rays on different materials, and the effect of the space environment on 12 million tomato seeds that have since been planted.

American Prospect , Spring 1990.\u00a0 \u00a0 The housing systems of the United States and Canada are similar in many respects. Most housing is constructed by private builders and financed by private lenders. Almost two-thirds of households own their own homes, primarily single-family houses. In Canada, as in the United States, housing prices have skyrocketed in the largest urban areas, particularly in Vancouver and Toronto. Middle-class citizens in both countries complain about the increasingly elusive dream of homeownership. \u00a0 But for Canada's poor and working-class residents, housing conditions are considerably better than they are for their U.S. counterparts. Canada has no slums to match the physical and social deterioration\u00a0 Jn\u00a0 our inner cities. Nor are Canada's cities overwhelmed with citizens sleeping in shelters, streets, and subways. Of course, there are homeless people in Canada and many lower-income households have great difficulty affording the housing they need, but they are relatively fewer in number.

The main focus of this study was the effect of pitch rate on the development and bursting of vortices generated from the leading edge extensions in the high angle of attack range with and without yaw. Results of this investigation indicate that that the vortex bursting point (relative to the static case) moves rearward with increasing pitch-up motion and forward with increasing pitch-down motion. For the same pitch rate, vortex bursting was found to occur earlier for the pitch-down motion than for the pitch-up motion, implying aerodynamic hysteresis effects. Yawing the model generated significant vortex asymmetries due to the delayed vortex breakdown on the leeward side for yaw angles of less than 10' . The presence of these asymmetric vortices led to undesirable side forces and yawing moments.","title":"A Flow Visualization Study of LEX Generated Vortices on a Scale Model of a F\/A-18 Fighter Aircraft at High Angles of Attack"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"aformalpproachto1094528230","subject":["Computer science","Fault Tree Analysis, Software Safety, Real-time software, Control software, Formal Models, Life-critical software, Safety Assessment."],"description":"As digital control systems are used in life-critical applications, assessment of the safety of these control systems becomes increasingly important. One means of formally performing this assessment is through fault tree analysis. Software Fault Tree Analysis (SFTA) starts with a system-level hazard that must be decomposed in a largely-human-intensive manner until specific modules of the software system are indicated. These modules can then be formally analyzed using statement templates. The focus of this thesis is to approach the decomposition of a system-level hazard from a formalized standpoint. Decomposition primarily proceeds along two distinct but interdependent dimensions, specificity of event and subsystem size. The Specificity-of-Event dimension breaks abstract or combined events into the specific system events that must be analyzed by the fault tree. The Subsystem-Size dimension deals with the scope of the hazard, and itemizes the subsystems where localized events may lead to the hazard. Decomposition templates are developed in this thesis to provide a framework for decomposing a system-level hazard to the point at which line-by-line code analysis can be conducted with existing statement templates. These templates serve as guides for conducting the decomposition, and ensure that as many as possible of all the applicable decomposition aspects are evaluated","title":"A formal approach to hazard decomposition in Software Fault Tree Analysis"},{"date":"1990-06-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"afqtscoreforecas1094534819","subject":["Qualified Military Available","AFQT score estimation","high quality recruit market"],"description":"Estimation of regional distributions of qualified military available (QMA) population is essential for determining an efficient allocation of recruiting resources.

This challenge led to the beginning of a new era in space technology and strategic defense, thus creating the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), better known as Star Wars. By 1984, several studies had begun to show that software in conjunction with Battle Management\/Command, Control, and Communications techniques would play a major role in determining the effectiveness of the SDI. The results from these studies caused numerous controversial debates on the reliability, dependability, and trustworthiness of the software. This thesis provides a framework for understanding the complexities of the SDI software and points out some of the major issues involved in the software debates. The structure for this thesis is based on presenting the opinions of various computer scientists and engineers, indicating the issues that are controversial and those that have been defined as a necessity for the SDI program. One of the major highlights is the SDI summary chart that provides the reader with a very brief narrative of each individual's opinion on the software issues discussed in this thesis.","title":"A framework for understanding the Strategic Defense Initiatives' software debates"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"africa0000murr_f6v8","subject":["Africa -- History -- Juvenile literature","Africa -- Civilization -- Juvenile literature","Africa"],"description":["96 p. : 31 cm","Describes the history of Africa and examines the tribes and cultures of its countries","Includes bibliographical references (p. 92) and index"],"title":"Africa"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"africa19900000dost","subject":["Africa -- Economic conditions","Arica Politics and government","Africa"],"description":["207 pages : 28 cm","Includes bibliographical references (pages 205-207)"],"title":"Africa, 1990"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"africacountsnumb00zasl","subject":["Ethnomathematics -- Africa, Sub-Saharan.","Games -- Africa, Sub-Saharan."],"title":"Africa counts"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"africadispatches00hard_0","subject":["Africa, Sub-Saharan -- Politics and government -- 1960-","Africa, Sub-Saharan -- Social conditions -- 1960-"],"title":"Africa"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"africaineraofcri0000hadj","subject":"Africa","description":"iii, 226 p. ; 24 cm","title":"Africa in an era of crisis"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"africalandandpeople","subject":["Economic history","Social conditions"],"description":["Cataloged from contributor's data","Intermediate grades and junior high school students","Takes a close look at Africa's varied geography and the people who settled and live in these regions.

In all of these, we place different constraints upon the problem and produce the familiar laws governing reflection and refraction. The main result of this research is the expression found for Snell's Law of Refraction in which the velocity of the light particles in the medium depends upon direction. We also use inverse problems to find the index of refraction needed to move along any desired family of curves. Finally, we derive a general expression that generates a family of curves given any index of refraction. This research has several applications in the area of acoustical and optical wave propagation. In the area of acoustics, the inverse problems enable us to predict the path followed by sound waves for a given medium. This would allow for military use in the area prosecuting submarine contacts and in ocean bottom surveys. The inverse problems also have applications to the bending of light rays used in laser technology. Although this paper derives several generalizations of Snell's Law of Refraction there are still areas that require further research.","title":"A generalization of Snell's law"},{"date":"1990-03-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"agenericsetofhfn1094534852","subject":["Antennas (Electronics)","Computer Simulation","Numerical Electromagnetics Code (NEC)","Tactical HF Field Antennas"],"description":"An antenna engineering handbook and database program has been constructed by engineers at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) using the Numerical Electromagnetics Code (NEC) antenna modeling program to prepare data performance on tactical field communication antennas used by the Army. It is desirable to have this information installed on a personnel computer (PC), using relational database techniques to select antennas based on performance criteria. This thesis obtains and analyses current distributions and radiation pattern data by using NEC for the following set of four (4) high frequency (HF) tactical generic antennas to be used in future spherical mode expansion work: a quarter wavelength basic whip, a one-wavelength horizontal quad Loop, a 564-foot longwire, and a sloping vee beam dipole. The results of this study show that the basic whip antenna provides good groundwave communication, but it has poor near vertical incident skywave (NVIS) performance. The current distribution has the characteristics of standing waves. The horizontal quad loop antenna is good for NVIS and medium range skywave communications. The current distribution is sinusoidal and continuous around the loop. The long wire antenna allows short, medium and long range communications and a standing wave current distribution occurs along the antenna axis due to non-termination. The sloping vee beam antenna favors long range communication and the current distribution is mainly that of travelling sinusoidal waves. Because of their well-known efficiency, the basic whip and quad loop can be used as reference standards for the spherical mode expansion work. The longwire and sloping \\\"vee beam\\\" antenna are unwieldy, but they are effective as base station antennas.","title":"A generic set of HF antennas for use with spherical mode expansions"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"agent-212-t-12-ris-o-poulet","subject":["Bande dessin\u00e9e","BD","b\u00e9d\u00e9","comic-book","comics","strip","Comic strip","fran\u00e7ais","francophone","French-speaking","auteur belge","French","Belgian author","fiction","bande dessin\u00e9e polici\u00e8re","policier","Police comic strip","policeman","police","humour","humor","Daniel Kox","Raoul Cauvin"],"description":"L'Agent 212 est une s\u00e9rie de bande dessin\u00e9e belge humoristique cr\u00e9\u00e9e en 1975 par Daniel Kox au dessin et Raoul Cauvin au sc\u00e9nario dans le n\u00b01939 du journal Spirou. Elle met en sc\u00e8ne l'agent 212, un agent de police d\u00e9bonnaire et gaffeur. La s\u00e9rie met en sc\u00e8ne un agent de police nonchalant et bien en chair, immatricul\u00e9 212, dans ses rapports avec ses sup\u00e9rieurs, ses coll\u00e8gues, son \u00e9pouse qui le mettent dans des situations comiques La premi\u00e8re apparition de l'agent 212 a eu lieu en 1975 dans le journal Spirou n\u00b01939. Il s'agit \u00e0 l'origine d'une s\u00e9rie qui ne devait pas durer, le dessinateur Daniel Kox tentait alors d'int\u00e9grer le studio de Peyo. En attendant il rencontre, par l'interm\u00e9diaire de Thierry Martens le r\u00e9dacteur en chef de Spirou, le sc\u00e9nariste Raoul Cauvin qui lui propose un sc\u00e9nario de gags avec un agent de police, mais la s\u00e9rie va int\u00e9resser le public et va continuer. Dupuis a ensuite publi\u00e9 27 albums de cette s\u00e9rie en fran\u00e7ais et n\u00e9erlandais.

They may also be affected by different environmental factors such as visual levels, sea states, terrains, etc. There is often interest in quantifying the effects of different observer characteristics and environmental factors on detection times. A hierarchical gammaWeibull regression model is considered which can incorporate observer characteristics and environmental effects which may influence the time to detect targets. Numerical procedures for the estimation of parameters of the hierarchical gammaWeibull model based on maximum likelihood are described. Results of simulation experiments to study small sample behavior of the estimates are reported.","title":"A hierarchical Gamma\/Weibull regression model for target detection times"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"ahlefarniente0000davi","description":"48 p. : 30 cm","title":"Ah!

Weather. Hundreds, even thousands of lives depend on your alert reactions to the Air Traffic Controller (ATC) radarscope. Complex three-dimensional calculations. Fuel consumption and time projections. Pilot and mechanical errors. Natural and man-made disasters. A swarm of flight crews and tower controllers making priority requests by the minute. Now you can take the Air Traffic Control Simulator chair of the controller, vectoring all the varied approach and departure traffic into a major metropolitan flight sector. Air Traffic Controller (ATC) pushes the limits of realism with new weather and intelligent pilot models. It's a high-stress juggling act, managing communications, approving altitude and heading changes while managing handoffs to other sector controllers or tower controllers. This is no game. ATC is the latest collaboration of Wesson International's simulation programmers and professional Air Traffic Controllers. ATC is a great way to learn control procedures, while lesson simulations teach the control language all pilots and controllers must learn. You choose among six high-traffic metro control sectors - Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle, Miami, Chicago and Boston. You control everything from general aviation Cessnas to scheduled Boeing 747s. Don't blink or you may overlook a low-fuel message or a request for an altitude deviation or destination change. Realistic weather patterns and random equipment failures challenge your calm. Links With Microsoft Flight Simulator ATC is Microsoft compatible. With your modem or null modem hookups, you can handle as many as four Flight Simulator targets (DOS & Windows versions only). Live link control communications into the Flight Simulator cockpit while their requests appear on your control screen. Other aircraft on your control scope even appear from the cockpit view of the Flight Simulator aircraft.

These configurations included conventional tractor, conventional pusher, canard, tandem-wing, joined-wing, and 3-surface designs, which were analyzed though the use of microcomputer-based performance and lattice-vortex programs. Actual experimental aircraft were utilized as models which were scaled to a useful load of 600 pounds and given a common powerplant of 115 horsepower. The joined-wing, tandem-wing and conventional pusher were found to exhibit sufficient improvement over a conventional tractor configuration to warrant serious consideration for design selection. The performance and stability programs provided reasonably accurate predictions of aircraft performance when given actual aircraft dimensions and power available data and warrant use for preliminary aircraft design.","title":"Aircraft configuration study for experimental 2-place aircraft and RPVs"},{"date":"1990-02-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"aircraftmodifica00boge","subject":["AIRCRAFT.","COST ANALYSIS.","MODIFICATION."],"description":["Cover title","\"NPS-54-90-005.\"","\"February 1990.\"","AD A220 764","Includes bibliographical references (p. 22-23)","As the budget for the development and production of new military aircraft tightens, modification of existing aircraft (MOD) has become increasingly important.

The measurement region was over the marginal ice zone, southeast of Spitzbergen, between 74 to 76 degs N and 19 to 27 degs E. Above the atmospheric boundary layer, the geostrophic wind was 12 ms at approximately 15 deg off-ice. A well mixed layer extended along the entire 200 km flight path which was perpendicular to and centered over the ice edge. There was a stratocumulus layer over the ocean which decreased in thickness towards the ice. The associated inversion, which coincided with the cloud layer top, continued to decrease in height over the ice. This caused a strong thermal wind effect within the atmospheric boundary layer. The near-surface geostrophic wind decreased from approximately 12 ms over the ocean to 5 ms over the ice due to the horizontal temperature gradient and sloping inversion.","title":"Aircraft observations of the atmospheric boundary layer in the vicinity of the marginal ice zone under conditions of flow parallel to the ice edge"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"aircraftprototyp0000chri","title":"aircraft prototypes"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"aircraftspecific00sout","subject":["Airplanes","Helicopters","Airtankers (Forest fire control)"],"description":["Second ed.

Aladdin belongs to the Multicom Entertainment Group. Two years before Disney's animated Aladdin movie came out (and over a decade before the woke live-action remake of that movie came out), Disney Channel aired a live-action Aladdin movie, based on a musical by the Prince Street Players, a former children's theater troupe from New York famed for their musical adaptations of various fairy tales. Like the original Aladdin story and unlike the later animated adaptation, this movie is set in China (despite just about every actor being white, but keep in mind, nobody bats an eyelash at nonwhite actors playing or voicing white characters), and in general it is more faithful to the original despite some differences (and I don't mean the aforementioned whiteness). Sure, its greenscreen effects haven't exactly aged well, but it's still a nice, lighthearted cult classic.","title":"Aladdin (1990)"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"aladdin-stuff-it-classic-users-guide-macintosh","subject":["aladdin","aladdin systems","user guide","user manual","manual","documentation","file compression","file archiving","file archive","utility","macintosh","mac","apple","archive utility","utility software"],"description":"Aladdin Systems Stuffit Classic\u2122 for the Apple Macintosh User Guide 1990","title":"Aladdin StuffIt Classic Users Guide Macintosh"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"aladdin0000dark","subject":["Folklore -- Arab countries","Arabs -- Folklore","Folklore","Arab countries","Children's stories in English, 1945- - Texts"],"description":"40 unnumbered pages","title":"Aladdin"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"aladdin0000spur","subject":"Children's stories","description":["27 unnumbered pages :","\"Startright elf book\"--Cover"],"title":"Aladdin"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"aladecouvertedes0000grie","subject":["Creative activities and seat work -- Juvenile literature","Activite\u0301s dirige\u0301es -- Ouvrages pour la jeunesse","Creative activities and seat work"],"description":["96 pages : 25 cm","De\u0301couvrir l'action du temps sur les choses, la nature, l'arche\u0301ologie, l'histoire a\u0300 travers diffe\u0301rentes activite\u0301s faciles et inte\u0301ressantes","Traduction de : Discover : mysteries of the past and present","\"Un livre du Royal Ontario Museum.\"","Comprend un index"],"title":"A\u0300 la de\u0301couverte des myste\u0300res du passe\u0301 et du pre\u0301sent"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"aladinetalibaba0000unse","description":"[44] p. : 21 cm","title":"Aladin.

this thesis is to perform a cost effectiveness analysis of the various purchasing methods available to Dudley Knox Library on the Naval Postgraduate School campus in Monterey, California. The intent of the study is to identify the most cost efficient method of procuring books within the guidelines of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR). The research was conducted by reviewing current literature and interviewing persons acquainted with the various cost elements which occur when purchasing books at the Naval Postgraduate School. Approval plans were found to be the least costly way for a Department of Defense library to purchase books if the library was large enough to sustain an approval plan.","title":"A least cost study for book procurement at the Naval Postgraduate School library"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"alecforbeshisfri00phil","subject":["Friendship -- Fiction","Scotland -- Fiction"],"title":"Alec Forbes and his friend Annie"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"alechisflyingbed0000buck","subject":["Beds -- Fiction","Flight -- Fiction"],"description":["1 v.

With the help of over 200 illustrations, Green surveys every significant aspect of Hellenistic cultural development, from mathematics to medicine, from philosophy to religion, from literature to the visual arts. Green offers a particularly trenchant analysis of what has been seen as the conscious dissemination in the East of Hellenistic culture, and finds it largely a myth fueled by Victorian scholars seeking justification for a no longer morally respectable imperialism.

Predator (also known as Aliens versus Predator, abbreviated AVP) is a comic book series published by Dark Horse Comics between 1989 and 2020 on an intermittent basis, written and drawn by various artists. Dark Horse also publishes the Aliens and Predator lines of comics. AVP is part of the crossover franchise originated and published by Dark Horse Comics. According to the notes which accompany the first Aliens versus Predator graphic novel, the original idea of combining the Aliens with Predators was the result of a late 1980s brain-storming session between the comic's creators (AVP artist and editor Chris Warner is specifically credited). Eventually, a film, Alien vs. Predator, was made in 2004, with a sequel in 2007 (called Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem) including a hybrid of a Xenomorph and a Predator.

Aber eigentlich ist \"Alles oder nichts\" die Aufzeichnung eines ziemlich dickk\u00f6pfigen und entschlossenen Mannes mittleren Alters, der beschlossen hat, die Geschichte eines anderen Mannes aufzuzeichnen; eines ziemlich paranoiden Zeitgenossen, der wiederum beschlossen hatte, sich f\u00fcr 365 Tage in ein Zimmer in New York City einzuschlie\u00dfen, um die Geschichte eben des jungen Mannes zu schreiben, der kurz nach dem Krieg in New York City eintrifft... Der Erz\u00e4hler \/ Der Erfinder \/ Der Aufzeichner der Geschichte erz\u00e4hlen im H\u00f6rspiel einfach alle durcheinander und halten sich an keinerlei Ordnung, was aber schlie\u00dflich doch zu einer h\u00f6heren \u00dcbersicht am Ende f\u00fchrt.

The main concerns of the remaining thirteen years of his reign are the building of his new capital at Baghdad, on which al-Tabari's text contains details not previously published in English, and his efforts to have his nephew 'Isa b. Musa replaced as heir apparent by his own son Muhammad al-Mahdi, a maneuver that required all his political skills. The circumstances of al-Mansur's death in 158\/775 are described in vivid detail, and this section is followed by a series of anecdotes, some serious, some humorous, most vivid and lively, that illustrate his character and habits. The last section of the volume describes the reign of al-Mahdi, more pious than his father but also more liberal and open-handed. Along with routine administration, space is devoted to the bizarre intrigues that accompanied the rise and fall of the vizier Ya'qub b. Dawud and the mysterious circumstances of the caliph's own death in 169\/785, followed by a short collection of character stories. In addition, the volume also contains important information about warfare on the Byzantine frontier and in Khurasan","Translation of extracts from: T\u0101r\u012bkh al-rusul

The study describes the development, reviews the basic audit procedures, and examines the five chapters of the CRAG Program. The research demonstrates that reduced duplication of effort was attained at General Dynamics' San Diego divisions through coordinated statistical sampling and audit planning.

This model of a manpower system consists of a two-dimensional state space Markov Model with special structure. The model provides manpower planners with the capability of testing alternative policies and adjusting model parameters to improve the use of personnel resources that are from three sources (Military Academy, Officer Military School, Officer Candidate School). Use of the model is illustrated in a detailed analysis of its application to Indonesian Army officers in steady-state. The calculations of stocks, time in grade or time in military, and promotion rate for every rank are included as the model's output. The thesis is presented with the user in mind, emphasizing the importance of a thorough understanding of the factors that influence planning in manpower system.","title":"A manpower planning model for the composition of officers of the Indonesian Army personnel system"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"amaranthus-et-al.-1990","subject":"Soil science","description":"A great amount of plant photosynthate is released from roots and supports a large and diverse population of soil organisms which greatly influence root growth and forest regeneration. This myriad of soil organisms and their interactions affect capture and uptake of plant nutrients and water, and contribute to the development and stability of soil structure. Numerous natural and man-caused activities can disturb above- and below-ground environments and potentially impact beneficial soil organisms and subsequent regeneration. Activities that minimize losses of organic matter, topsoil and soil porosity have the least impact. Diminished root and mycorrhiza formation on seedlings outplanted onto disturbed sites can slow regeneration, especially in areas where the period favorable for seedling growth is short. Ectomycorrhizal fungi supported by non-coniferous hosts can actively colonize feeder roots of conifer seedlings. Thus, seedlings may \"plug into\" the network of compatible ectomycorrhizal hyphae supported by pioneering hardwood species, thereby gaining opportunity for early ectomycorrhizal formation and establishment on harsh sites. Management strategies that avoid negative impacts on the belowground ecosystem are discussed and encouraged.","title":"Soil organisms, root growth and forest regeneration"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"amarec20210523-2201_edit","subject":["spelling bee","educational","St. Louis","St. Louis Post-Dispatch","KPLR-TV","Missouri","Illinois","competition"],"description":"A spelling bee produced St. Louis Post-Dispatch (the main newspaper of the city of St. Louis) and KPLR-TV.

The widespread availability of small computers has changed life for these radio enthusiasts. Old modes of communication, such as morse and even voice, have been joined by new, computer-based methods of communication. In addition, older modes of machine to machine communication, such as radio teletype (RTTY) are now being performed by silent computers rather than large, oily, clanking teletype machines. Computers are also used as circuit design tools, to replace test equipment, to act as filing clerks and even to control receivers and transmitters. Listeners use them to decode meteorological information and signals from amateur radio satellites. They even use computers to predict which frequencies to use for the best results. Contents: Basic radio principles; Basic computer principles; Software for electronic design; Software for aerial design; Logkeeping and QSL card software; Satellite and geographical software; Miscellaneous software; Interfacing the computer to the radio; Morse code; RTTY and ASCII; AMTOR; SSTV and FAX; Packet radio; Commercial decoders; Controlling a radio with a computer; Computer assisted circuit development; Appendices. Newnes Amateur Radio Computing Handbook is for all radio amateurs and short wave listeners who want to use computers in their activities. It will solve many problems and provide numerous ideas.

Catchy, appealing headlines for each topic, a lively style of writing, and thousands of illustrations make this comprehensive work attractive. Birth, funeral customs, sports, medicine, everyday eating customs, music, use of stimulants, and the roles of children, men, and women are all explored and illustrated with photographs of authentic items and drawings taken from museums and libraries around the world, including reproductions from original 16th-century drawings carried back to Spain to report on life in the New World.

Bridging the chasm between educational and social history, this book was one of the first to examine developments in higher education in the context of the social, economic, and political forces that were shaping the nation at large. Surveying higher education from the colonial era through the mid-twentieth century, Rudolph explores a multitude of issues from the financing of institutions and the development of curriculum to the education of women and blacks, the rise of college athletics, and the complexities of student life. In his foreword to this new edition, John Thelin assesses the impact that Rudolph's work has had on higher education studies. The new edition also includes a bibliographic essay by Thelin covering significant works in the field that have appeared since the publication of the first edition. At a time when our educational system as a whole is under intense scrutiny, Rudolph's seminal work offers an important historical perspective on the development of higher education in the United States. --","Spine title: The American college & university","Reprint.

The authors systematically dismantle arguments, used in the assault, that U.S. welfare is economically undesirable, unaffordable, and ungovernable; and successfully defend America's welfare achievements while correcting and dispelling popular misconceptions and myths about it. The authors reject comprehensive reform but promote workable incremental reforms, compatible with America's fundamental ideological beliefs, to specific welfare programs.

Examples of errors and inconsistencies that may be contained in a DBMS are: Referential integrity violations, logical inconsistencies, redundancies and out-of-range values. During a conversion of database management systems, the errors and inconsistencies in the source system must be corrected so the data entered into the new target DBMS will be accurate. The goal of this thesis is to examine a source database management system to determine what errors and inconsistencies are possible, to propose a methodology to detect them, and to correct such errors and inconsistencies prior to entering the data into the target DBMS. In applying my proposals, the thesis will examine the specific systems utilized by the United States Military Academy (USMA) at West Point, New York. The Academy uses a UNISYS 110072 mainframe computer in support of its existing network model DBMS. West Point proposes to convert network model to a relational model system.

Among these problems is the ability to control the submersible given its highly nonlinear operation environment. In order to account for these variations, robust control techniques must be used. In particular, Variable Structure Control (VSC) with Doyle-Stein Observer has proven to produce optimal results while maintaining a high degree of robustness. This led to the development of a real-time error detector using the robust observer to provide system redundancy through software. The culmination of this work is a real-time autopilot written in the \"C\" language which is ready for implementation and testing in the Naval Postgraduate School AUV prototype. We also address the aspect of real-time signal processing and conditioning in terms of Synchro-toResolver Conversion and anti-aliasing filters. The synchro problem involves converting a nonpotentiometric directional gyro output to a natural binary format which calls for an intricate design of power transformers, analog-to-digital converter, and passive element components. Lastly, the use of Generalized-Immittance Converter circuitry in the design of very low frequency anti-aliasing filter applications is developed and tested.","title":"A microcomputer-based controller for an Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV)"},{"date":"1990-03-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"amicrocomputertu1094521441","subject":["Management","Tutorial","Microcomputer","Budget simulation","Computer aided learning","Tutorial development","Spreadsheet tutorial","Database tutorial"],"description":"The objective of this thesis is to illustrate to financial managers in the Practical Controllership Course (PCC) some of the potential for microcomputers in budget preparation and execution.

Denn Maschinensprache lernen hei\u00dft nicht, seitenweise Tabellen und Adressierungsarten auswendig zu lernen. Hier wird Ihnen eine leichtverst\u00e4ndliche Einf\u00fchrung in die Maschinenprogrammierung des Amiga geboten, die keinerlei Vorkenntnisse voraussetzt, so da\u00df Sie gleich von Anfang an ohne Fachchinesisch Spa\u00df am Programmieren haben. Nat\u00fcrlich zeigt Ihnen dieses Buch auch, wie schnell man zum Amiga-Profi aufsteigen kann, denn ein entsprechendes Aufsteigerkapitel rundet das Werk ab. Und ganz nebenbei werden Sie auch noch mit dem gebr\u00e4uchlichsten Assembler auf dem Amiga vertraut gemacht, dem SEKA-Assembler. Die verschiedenen Anh\u00e4nge bieten Ihnen schlie\u00dflich eine Pannenhilfe, denn nicht alles klappt gleich beim erstem Mal, ein umfangreiches Fachwortlexikon und nat\u00fcrlich eine komplette Befehlsreferenz des SEKA-Assemblers. Besser Damit Sie von Anfang an gleich richtig loslegen k\u00f6nnen. Richtiger Einsatz von Maschinensprache an vielen praktischen Beispielen. Schneller Durch den schnellen Erfolg k\u00f6nnen Sie schon nach k\u00fcrzester Zeit Ihre eigenen Intuition-Fenster und die verschiedensten Diskettenoperationen problemlos programmieren. Praktischer Auch wenn Sie nicht mit dem SEKA-Assembler arbeiten, zeigen wir Ihnen, wie man den SEKA-Source an andere Assembler anpa\u00dft.","title":"Amiga - Maschinensprache f\u00fcr Einsteiger (rescan)"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"amiga-oberon","subject":["Commodore Amiga","programming","compiler","Oberon"],"description":"Amiga Oberon-2 Compiler Manual","title":"Amiga Oberon"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"amiga-original-power-monger-1990-bullfrog","subject":["amiga","video game","disk image"],"description":"Amiga game Power Monger by Bullfrog.","title":"Amiga Original Power Monger [ 1990] [ Bullfrog]"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"amiga-rom-kernal-reference-manual-libraries-and-devices","subject":["Commodore Amiga","technical reference series","libraries and devices"],"description":"REVISED & UPDATED Intuition: Introduction Intuition: Screens Intuition: Windows Intuition: Gadgets Intuition: Menues Intuition: Requesters and Alters Intuition: Input and Output Methods Intuition: Images, Line Drawing And Text Intuition: Mouse and Keyboard Intuition: Other Features Intuition: Style Intuition: Functions Intuition: Internal Procedures Exec: Libraries Exec: Memory Allocation Exec: Lists and Queue Exec: Tasks Exec: Messages and Ports Exec: Input\/Output Exec: Semaphores Exec: Interrupts Exec: ROM-Wack Graphics: Primitives Graphics: Text Graphics: Sprites, Bobs and Animation Layers Library Expansion Library Math Libraries Translator Library Workbench Audio Device Clipboard Device Console Device Gameport Device Input Device Keyboard Device\u00a0 Narrator Device Parallel Device Printer Device Serial Device Timer Device Trackdisk Resources Appendix A Troubleshooting Your Software Appendix B Linker Libraries Appendix C Floppy Boot Process and Physical Layout Glossary Index","title":"Amiga ROM Kernal Reference Manual Libraries And Devices 2nd Edition"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"amiga-sh-10","subject":["Commodore","Commodore Amiga","BASIC programming","BASIC compiler: GFA-Basic","AC-Basic","HiSoft-Basic"],"description":"AMIGA Magazin - Sonderheft 10 - BASIC Grundlagen: Leichter Einstieg in die BASIC-Programmierung Einbindung von System- & Assembler-Routinen Hardware-Programmierung in BASIC Tools: Compiler: AC-, GFA- und HiSoft-Basic Utilities: Profi-File-Requester Top-Zeichenprogramm in BASIC","title":"Amiga Magazin Sonderheft 10 - BASIC"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"amiga-sh-9","subject":["Commodore Amiga","software listings","programming","magazine","german"],"description":"20 Programme zum Sparpreis Tolle Spiele Faszinierende Grafikprogramme N\u00fctzliche Anwendungen Hilfreiche Tools","title":"Amiga Sonderheft 9 - Die besten Listings des Jahres"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"amiga-special-software-praxis","subject":["Commodore Amiga","applications","tutorials","workshops","german"],"description":"TIPS - TRICKS - KURSE und abgeschlossene WORKSHOPS zu den wichtigsten Amiga-Programmen Deluxe Paint III Digi Paint III Deluxe Video III Beckertext II PAGE STREAM Amiga TEX Word Perfect Reflections Modelder 3D Superbase Prof. Zeichentrick und 3D Kurs Oktalyzer Amiga Magic Turbo Silver Sound & Midi","title":"Amiga Software Praxis"},{"date":"1990-06-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"amiga-ultima6-ntsc","subject":["amiga","ultima","origin systems","ntsc"],"description":"Amiga ADF files for Ultima VI","title":"Amiga Ultima VI NTSC"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"amiga-user-international-vol-4-4","subject":"Amiga User International","description":"Not my scan.

Written by experts in their specialist fields the series creates a unique service for the active research chemist, supplying regular critical in-depth accounts of progress in particular areas of chemistry. For over 80 years the Royal Society of Chemistry and its predecessor, the Chemical Society, have been publishing reports charting developments in chemistry, which originally took the form of Annual Reports. However, by 1967 the whole spectrum of chemistry could no longer be contained within one volume and the series Specialist Periodical Reports was born. The Annual Reports themselves still existed but were divided into two, and subsequently three, volumes covering Inorganic, Organic and Physical Chemistry. For more general coverage of the highlights in chemistry they remain a 'must'. Since that time the SPR series has altered according to the fluctuating degree of activity in various fields of chemistry. Some titles have remained unchanged, while others have altered their emphasis along with their titles; some have been combined under a new name whereas others have had to be discontinued.

This is evidenced by its widespread use in industrial and military applications ranging from deep-ocean exploration to anti-submarine warefare. Indeed, the feasiblity of short-range, special-purpose vehicles (whether aunonomous or remotely operated) is no longer in question. The research efforts have now begun to shift their focus on development of reliable, longer-range, high-endurance and fully autonomous systems. One of the major underlying technologies required to realize this goal is Artificial Intelligence (AI). The latter offers great potential to endow vehicles with the intelligence needed for full autonomy and extended range capability; this involves the increased application of AI technologies to support mission planning and execution, navigation and contingency planning. This thesis addresses two issues associated with the above goal for Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUV's). Firstly, a new approach is proposed for path planning in underwater environments that is capable of dealing with uncharted obstacles and which requires significantly less planning time and computer memory. Secondly, it explores the use of expert system technology in the planning of AUV missions.","title":"A Mission Planning Expert System with Three-Dimensional Path Optimization for the NPS Model 2 Autonomous Underwater Vehicle"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"ammoniaplantsafe0000unse_d6f9","subject":["Ammonia -- Congresses","Chemical plants -- Safety measures -- Congresses","Ammonia","Chemical plants -- Safety measures"],"description":["253 pages","A continuation of the series Safety in air and ammonia plants"],"title":"Ammonia plant safety (and related facilities) : a technical manual.

Automated software development methods, like Rapid Prototyping, have served to increase the maintainability of modern software systems, and increase customer participation in the requirements definition process. This makes software systems more maintainable and increases customer satisfaction with the first version of the system. Still, changes are inevitable. The part of the maintenance problem that automated tools currently do not address, is the automatic propagation of changes through multiple versions of the same system. The Prototype System Description Language (PSDL) is a language used exclusively for designing and executing rapid prototypes. This thesis is directed at developing a model for automatically merging two different versions of a PSDL program, providing a method for propagating changes through multiple versions of that program.","title":"A model for merging different versions of a PSDL program"},{"date":"1990-06-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"amodelforpropuls1094537529","subject":["Operations research","Logistics","Naval","Energy consumption","Fuel consumption","POL","Aircraft carrier","Naval logistics"],"description":"Speed and propulsion fuel consumption characteristics of United States aircraft carriers are modeled to determine how unpredictabilities in operational, engineering, and wartime environments affect the endurance capability of the ship. Research into the characteristics of steam propulsion plants on ships show that variability may exist in the amount of propulsion fuel required to support ship operation for a given period of time. Sources if this variability include the nonlinear transformation of operational data into fuel logistics data, the nearly deterministic engine reacting to inputs from a stochastic environment, and the effects of increased engine wear and ship's crew fatigue on engine performance. Implementations of this variation in a simulation indicate that conventional estimation techniques for fuel consumption may seriously overestimate the endurance capability if the aircraft carriers. The simulation results show that the distribution of endurance time resembles a normal distribution, with the estimated mean decreasing variance increasing as unpredictabilities in various environments are considered.","title":"A Model for the Propulsion Fuel Consumption of an Aircraft Carrier"},{"date":"1990-06-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"amodelofsoftware1094523454","description":"The maintenance of large military software systems is complex, involves users as well as software professionals, and requires appropriate management, which is one of the most important factors in efficient maintenance. Maintenance management requires information about the current state of the maintenance process that should be organized within a maintenance-oriented Enginering Database. This database should include all the necessary data about software changes, system configeration, maintenance task scheduling, etc., and it should be based on a realistic model of the maintenance process. This tesis proposes a mathematical Model of Software Maintenance that uses graphs to model the relationships between maintenance tasks and software components. The Model addresses the dynamic behavior of the maintenance process and supports priority and precedence of maintenance activities. The proposed Model of Software Maintenance provides a sound basis for implementation of a maintenance-oriented engineering database that supports automation of maintenance management, e.g., process control, task scheduling, job assignments, planning and forecast, gathering and interpretation of maintenance statistics and metrics, etc.","title":"A Model of Software Maintenance for Large Scale Military Systems"},{"date":"1990-09-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"amodernnavalcomb1094534899","subject":["Naval art and science","Mathematical models","Naval battles","Naval tactics","War","Maritime (International law)","Surface-to-surface missiles","Mathematical models.","Naval combat models","combat theory","salvo warfare","human factors in combat models"],"description":"This report develops a modern naval combat model. It deals with naval surface missile combat and models the attrition as a force-on-force process described in discrete time steps, or slaves. The degradation of each force is expressed in terms of remaining staying power and combat power in both opponents. It is based on Lt. Beall's model, but since it deals with missile warfare it incorporates several human factors that affect the outcome of a naval battle: specifically scouting effectiveness, leadership, morale, and training.","title":"A modern naval combat model"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"amongmadmen0000star","description":"268 p","title":"Among madmen"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"amongschoolchild00kidd","subject":["Elementary school teaching","Fifth grade (Education)"],"description":["\"A Richard Todd book\"--T.p. verso","Includes bibliographical references"],"title":"Among schoolchildren"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"amongstwomen00mcga","title":"Amongst women"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"amontourlesmemoi0000reag","subject":["Reagan, Nancy, 1923-","Reagan, Ronald, 1911-","Reagan, Ronald","Reagan, Nancy, 1923- ..","Reagan, Ronald, 1911-2004","Reagan, Nancy -- biographie","Pre\u0301sidents -- Conjoints -- E\u0301tats-Unis -- Biographies"],"description":"378 pages - pages de planches : 24 cm","title":"A\u0300 mon tour : les me\u0301moires de Nancy Reagan"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"amopoly-1-4","subject":["Games","Amiga","Monopoly","German","ADF"],"description":"Monopoly Game for Amiga computers This is version v1.40 - which has many more optional gameplay features then the v1.32 you can already find on the internet.
