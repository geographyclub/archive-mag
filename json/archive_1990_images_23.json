Offering 5 skill levels, it is up to you to capture all your opponents pieces on the game board. You are allowed to move a single space in one direction (up) if no jumps are available. If you are able to jump an opponent's piece, you must do so. Jumping an opponent's piece (or pieces if you can do a multiple jump), captures the piece(s). If you get any of your pieces to the farthest end of the board, you are \"kinged\". This means that your piece can now move in any direction; offering a distinct advantage. The game allows for 0 to 2 human players. The computer will make up the remaining players to equal 2 players total. You can choose to play as red or black, and can even switch sides.

It is designed to run on MS-DOS or PC-DOS 3.31 or higher. It was a major improvement over Windows 2.x, featuring a completely revamped user interface. It features a new graphical user interface (GUI) where applications are represented as clickable icons, as opposed to the list of file names seen in its predecessors. Later updates would expand the software's capabilities, one of which added multimedia support for sound recording and playback, as well as support for CD-ROMs. Windows 3.0 can run in up to 24-bit color mode, given the proper display driver and graphics card. It was the last version to support 8088\/8086 real mode (640k RAM) as Windows 3.1 only offered \"Standard mode\" (max 16MB RAM on 80286) and \"386 Enhanced mode\" (on 80386). Regardless of which mode is chosen, Windows 3.0 cannot recognize more than 16 MB of RAM. Officially supported by Microsoft until December 31, 2001. Windows 3.0 sold 10 million copies.

In Milwaukee, the Ignaces enjoy a mainstream upper class life style, acknowledging the loss of some Indian traditions, while Del Porter has found an extended family in neighborhood gathering places. Porter\u2019s daughter travels between the city and the reservation trying to strike a balance in her identity as an individual and as an Indian. At a Hopi reservation, Pat Ross and her family have returned to meet resistance in rejoining the clan. With choices come trade-offs. As Indians nations work to accommodate change and offer new opportunities from within, some stay, others still leave. For all of them, the ties to Indian life, while not easily undone, are being challenged by the future. Hattie Kauffman, national correspondent for CBS THIS MORNING, is the host of \u201cWinds of Change: A Matter of Choice,\u201d the second in a two-part series produced by Wisconsin Public Television. Kauffman, a winner of four Emmy Awards, was a special correspondent for ABC\u2019s GOOD MORNING AMERICA and a substitute for host Joan Lunden before joining CBS in March 1990. Born on a reservation in Idaho, Kauffman is half Nez Perce and half German.

Scott Momaday (PBS Home Video, 1990) Running Time: 1 Hour Winds of Change: A Matter of Promises This is the rarely told story of nations within a nation, of the sovereign Indian tribes that survive in America today. \u201cLike a rock that a river runs around,\u201d is how one Indian describes his nation in the stream of U.S. life. \u201cWinds of Change: A Matter of Promises\u201d draws us into the lives of these Native Americans today, and the challenges they face as they try to preserve their cultures. It is a story of promises kept and treaties broken, seen through the eyes of three distinct tribes. Hosted by Pulitzer Prize-winning author N. Scott Momaday, \u201cA Matter of Promises\u201d takes us first to the nation of the Onondaga people of New York State. We see a land of great beauty, where buffalo still roam and people carry a passport recognized around the world. We also see how they strive to preserve their clan among young people, and what happens when youth leave the reservation for schools and jobs. In a society traced through women, where no child is ever illegitimate, a noble way of life endures. \u201cA Matter of Promises\u201d also travels to Arizona, to the legendary Navajo nation. A place the size of Ireland, of vast skies and huge vistas, this is a land with no private ownership, no addresses. We see instead how they pursue a tradition of peacemaking, with a judicial system that ranges from a police force to a superior court. Intent on preserving their complex language and culture, the Navajo reveal a deep wisdom, which fosters their identity as a unique people. Equally distinct is the Lummi nation of Washington state, an island people who have come to symbolize the Indian struggle for self-determination. \u201cWinds of Change: A Matter of Promises\u201d traces their fight to retain their ancient fishing rights: a fight for sovereignty they have taken seven times to the U.S. Supreme Court. We get an intimate look at how they use the traditional \u2018talking circle\u2019 to achieve coop-eration, and how they preserve the balance of nature in the waters around them.\u00a0 \u201cWinds of Change: A Matter of Promises\u201d carries the viewer to many diverse settings, on a journey fueled by the spirit of hope. The ties of Indian nationhood may be strained by the pressures of modern U.S. life, but the nobility of this struggle is an inspiration. As one Indian observed: \u201cHumankind has not woven the web of life. We are but a thread of it.\u201d PBS 262 \u2022 Color \u2022 60 Minutes \u00a91990 Wisconsin Educational Communications Board and Board of Regents UW System. All rights reserved.

Here Leo Loubre examines how the modernization of Western society has brought about new conditions in well-established markets, making the introduction of novel techniques and processes a matter of survival for winegrowers. Not only does Loubre explain how altered environmental conditions have enabled pioneering enologists to create styles of wine more suited to contemporary tastes and living arrangements, but he also discusses the social impact of the wine revolution on the employees in the industry. The third generation of this new viticultural regime has encountered working and living conditions drastically different from those of its predecessors, while witnessing the near disappearance of the working class and the decline of small and medium growers of ordinary wines.

They show how the modern sportsperson can learn to incorporate important new methods into standard training programmes in an effort to achieve extra performance.

Morden weaves the ideas and moral attitudes that existed in the middle decades of the twentieth century to chronicle thirty-three years of WAC history from V-J Day 1945 to 20 October 1978, when the Women's Army Corps was abolished by Public Law 95-584 and discontinued by Department of the Army General Order 20, with the WAC officers assimilated into the other branches of the Army (except the combat arms). For the most part taking a chronological approach, Morden focuses on the interaction of plans, decisions, and personalities that affected the WAC directors as they pushed and prodded the Army, the Department of Defense, and Congress to achieve Regular Army and Reserve status, military credit for Women's Army Auxiliary Corps service, and promotion above the grade of lieutenant colonel. The early WAC directors, according to Morden, had the task of fighting for progress and equity, whereas their successors fought a losing battle to keep entry standards high and to retain the corps' separate status. She provides readers with a comprehensive picture of WAC growth and development and the transformation in the status of Army women brought by the advent of the all-volunteer Army and the women's rights movement of the seventies","Society for Military History Distinguished Book Award, 1991"],"title":"The Women's Army Corps, 1945-1978"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"womensautobiogra0000unse_c4u0","subject":["Women's studies -- Iran -- Biographical methods -- Congresses","Women -- Iran -- Biography -- History and criticism -- Congresses","Autobiography -- Women authors -- Congresses","Women and literature -- Iran -- Congresses"],"description":["78 p. ; 20 cm","Includes bibliographical references (p.

On the other hand, women's wage labour has been described as supplementary or marginal to the household income as well as to economic development as a whole. The contributors to this collection did their research on women workers in countries from the core, the semiperiphery, and the periphery. The eight articles are introduced by Kathryn Ward, who presents a critical overview of the literature on women workers and globalization. In Ward's opinion we have to develop new definitions for some key concepts in our theories on women and work. These concepts should aim at including housework and work in the informal sector, and women's various acts of resistance.

Suddenly, she sees a white rabbit who was hurrying somewhere, muttering something to himself. Curious, Alice follows the rabbit into a hole that leads into a bizarre world populated by strange and exotic creatures. Alice has to use her wits in order to understand Wonderland's twisted laws of logic and figure out a way to return home. Wonderland \u00a0is a text adventure with graphics, based on Lewis Carroll's classic novel\u00a0 Alice in Wonderland . The game follows the book's general story while adding many descriptions, locations, and puzzles of its own. The interaction with the environment is done mostly by typing; however, commands may also appear in pop-up menus and can be selected by the player. Sometimes puzzles need to be solved in order to be able to advance. The game features windows with adjustable size, separating the graphical display from inventory, command interface, text descriptions, and other options.

A Palaeozoic fauna of extinct orders and suborders, diverse in size, habitat, habit, and diet, was progressively replaced in the Permian by the stem-groups and early representatives of extant orders. The distribution in time of the Palaeozoic orders, and the first appearances of superfamilies of most of the remaining orders, are figured and discussed. There is no very strong evidence for explosive supraordinal radiations following significant evolutionary events, and the first appearances of important groups are not always immediately followed by major diversification. Within orders rapid expansions can be recognized following the presumed appearance of new type of larva, and particularly in association with the rise of the angiosperms, which provided the impetus for massive radiations at several trophic levels.","title":"Major insect radiations"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"worcesterstateun1990worc","subject":["Worcester State University","Universities and colleges--Massachusetts--Worcester","Course catalogs"],"title":"Worcester State University Course catalog"},{"date":"1990-02-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"word-perfect-5.0-for-os-2-5.0-1990-02-english-3.5-1.44-mb","subject":["WordPerfect","OS\/2","Word Processor"],"description":"WordPerfect 5.0 For OS\/2 ( 5.0) ( 1990 02) [ English] ( 3.5'' 1.44 MB) The 5.25\" version is here .

This fact does nothing to dim the curiosity of those intent on finding a key to unlock the hidden meanings in the conversation between creator and muse. As is well-known, the observation of something usually changes the thing being observed. Still the desire to know the unknowable persists. This is the dilemma at the heart of WORDS FOR THE DYING, the 1990 documentary on John Cale and Brian Eno, directed by Rob Nilsson. The film follows Cale and Eno (and Nilsson, who shows you his camera and sound equipment, making no attempt to delude viewers into thinking they're observing \"reality\") as they travel through Moscow, London, Wales and Amsterdam in preparation for the recording of \"The Falklands Suite,\" the work at the core of Cale's 1989 album Words for the Dying. WORDS FOR THE DYING shows the artists and filmmaker as the struggle to come to some understanding of the creative process. It doesn't sugarcoat matters as is evident from the first shot in which Eno, smirking cynically, goes on at length about his reluctance to take part in the film, while Cale laughs nervously and Nilsson does a headstand. The clash of egos is set up and continues to unfold for the rest of the film. (Despite his alleged decision to opt out, there is a shot of Eno in the control booth wearing a wireless mic that makes it possible for the filmmaker to capture all his comments, even the snide asides, so one wonders how unwilling he actually was).\" -j. poet","title":"Words for the Dying (1990)"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"wordsaroundfire00gail","subject":["Religion - Contemporary Issues","Religion - Socialissues","Religion","General","Reference","Vigils (Liturgy)","Holy Saturday","Easter","Lutheran Church"],"description":"Includes bibliographical references","title":"Words around the fire : reflections on the Scriptures of the Easter Vigil"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"wordsdoingthings00clar","subject":["Occupations","Vocabulary"],"description":"Depicts words and pictures about different activities and professions","title":"Words doing things"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"wordsforeaster0000unse","subject":"Easter","description":"63 pages","title":"Words for Easter"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"wordsforloverssn0000shak","description":["86 pages : 21 cm","Snippets, Sonnets & Sensual Sayings from William Shakespeare","Includes index"],"title":"Words for lovers : snippets, sonnets and sensual sayings"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"wordsfornewreade0000unse","subject":["English language -- Dictionaries, Juvenile","English language -- Dictionaries"],"description":["312 p. : 29 cm","Defines 1500 words, using each one in a sentence and giving special forms of the entry words, such as plurals, when appropriate"],"title":"Words for new readers"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"wordsforsale0000unse","subject":["Authorship","Publishers and publishing -- Canada"],"description":["xvii, 200 p","cn 90093672 t_oclc"],"title":"Words for sale"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"wordsheardoverhe0000gros","subject":["Drama -- 20th century -- History and criticism","Literary style","Drama","Sprache","Aufsatzsammlung","Strukturanalyse","Funktion","Geschichte (1965-1982)","Drama Composition (Arts)"],"description":["xv, 170 pages ; 23 cm","Includes bibliographical references (pages 161-170)"],"title":"Words heard and overheard : the main text in contemporary drama"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"wordsinmyday00naga","subject":"Rabbits","description":"Cover title","title":"Words in my day"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"wordsmith-made","subject":"toyota nissan ford chevrolet","description":"toyota nissan ford chevrolet","title":"Wordsmith Made"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"wordsmithswinner0000unse","description":"32 p. ; 21 cm","title":"Wordsmiths : the winners of the Guildhall Press Tenth Anniversary Short Story Competition"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"wordsmusic0000mahe","description":["125 p. ; 23 cm","Translation of: Paroles et musique"],"title":"Words and music"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"wordsmusicinhenr0028mull","subject":"Purcell, Henry, 1659-1695.

This represents the first time in which The Works of Saint Augustine will all be translated into English. Many existing translations were often archaic or faulty, and the scholarship was outdated. New City Press is proud to offer the best modern translations available. The Works of Saint Augustine, A Translation for the 21st Century will be translated into 49 published books. To date, 41 books have been published by NCP containing 93 of The Works of Saint Augustine, A Translation for the 21st Century.

Te program is designed to provide a single transparent means of controlling all the MIDI devices in a setup using the System Exclusive codes for each device to operate it independently. Under the program's control an asortment of MIDI gear from a variety of manufacturers behaves as a single instrument with various views. This version works in Standard and Enhanced mode, and is compatible with Windows 3.1. X-oR now supports the MPU401 driver provided by Microsoft Corp. as part of the Multimedia Extensions (and Windows 3.1). Make sure that the MPU401 driver is properly installed in the Drivers section of Control Panel. All references to MIDIDRV or any other type of driver in the manual is obsolete. By default, X-oR will attempt to use MIDI In Device 0 and MIDI Out Device 0. These assignments can be changed using the \"MIDI Devices\" menu item (in the Get\/Send menu). This dialog also allows to set specific Sysex buffer lengths and number of buffers. The default is 5 buffers of 1024 bytes. Any number of buffers of any length can be used, provided the total space is less than 64K. Sysex buffers do not have to be long enough for the maximum possible message! The default setting \"should\" be OK except for instruments like the CZ-101, which does not converse with the host in complete sysex messages. For such a synth, use a sysex buffer size of 1 bytes, and use 500 buffers. The MIDI settings you select will be written to WIN.INI under the [Midiapi] section. After installing X-or to your hard drive, you have to copy the profiles from the X-oR Profiles disks to the directory X-oR resides in. Most profiles also have a coresponding help file (.HLP) 1- Log on to the X-oR directory type: C:&lt;enter&gt;\u00a0\u00a0 CD\\XOR&lt;enter&gt; (where C: is the drive letter where X-or is installed) 2- copy the desired profile from the profile disk type: COPY A:\\MANUFACTURER\\PROFILE.* (where MANUFACTURER is the name of the device's manufacturer, and PROFILE is the name of the X-oR profile) ie: to copy the Roland D50 profile type: COPY A:\\ROLAND\\D50.* You may have to get a directory listing of the Profile disk to see the names of the manufacturer directories and profiles.","title":"X-oR V 1.2 MIDI Sound Creation Station"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"xpngtognahtnxpng0000unse","title":"xpngtog n ahtnxpngt"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"xray1990medi","subject":["Medical College of Virginia -- Students -- Yearbooks","College yearbooks -- Virginia -- Richmond"],"description":"The yearbook of Medical College of Virginia.

They investigate near a large wall of ice where\u00a0 Piccolo \u00a0is training. Meanwhile, the\u00a0 mad scientist \u00a0Dr. Kochin, having successfully gathered all of the Dragon Balls, summons the eternal dragon Shenron and\u00a0 wishes \u00a0for Dr. Wheelo and his lab to be released from the ice. The ice breaks away as a building emerges and Gohan and Oolong are attacked by Dr. Kochin's \"bio-men\". Piccolo saves them but is overcome by three mysterious warriors while Gohan and Oolong escape. Dr. Kochin and his bio-men soon present themselves to\u00a0 Master Roshi \u00a0who refuses to accompany them to Wheelo's lab and defeats the bio-men. Dr. Kochin kidnaps\u00a0 Bulma \u00a0to force Master Roshi to pursue them. At Wheelo's lab, Master Roshi is forced to fight three \"bio-warriors\" but is swiftly defeated. Bulma discovers that Dr. Wheelo's mission is to obtain the body of the strongest warrior on Earth to become the host for his brain, which is currently separated from his deceased body and kept alive by his advanced technology. Bulma informs him that\u00a0 Goku \u00a0will undoubtedly be coming to rescue them and that he is much more powerful than Roshi. Meanwhile, Goku learns of situation and he arrives at Dr. Wheelo's lab and is confronted by Mikokatsun, Kishime, and Ebifurya \u2013 Dr. Kochin's three bio-warrior\u00a0 henchmen . Goku defeats Mikokatsun but is frozen by an ice-like attack launched by Ebifurya. Gohan and\u00a0 Krillin \u00a0arrive to help but are no match for Kishime. Goku breaks free from ice with his Kaio-ken technique, defeats the two remaining bio-warriors, and confronts Dr. Wheelo. Piccolo, who has been brainwashed by Dr. Wheelo, attacks Goku. Gohan tries to stop Piccolo but fails, causing his anger to explode, shattering Dr. Wheelo's brainwashing device. Dr. Wheelo is stunned by Gohan's power and desires to steal his body instead. He breaks his\u00a0 robot \u00a0body free from the ice wall, subsequently knocking Dr. Kochin down a shaft which kills him. Dr. Wheelo attacks, overwhelms the fighters, and only Goku and Piccolo are left to oppose him. Goku knocks Dr. Wheelo into the atmosphere and begins to form a Spirit Bomb attack. Wheelo interrupts him before he can finish gathering the\u00a0 energy \u00a0for it requiring Goku's allies to distract Wheelo. Goku's successfully launches the bomb and Wheelo is killed.","title":"[Xtrem] Dragon Ball Z: The World's Strongest [Dragon Ball Z Movie 02] [Subtitles

The HDVS disc format was designed to be a highly portable 12\" laserdisc-derived media format for Sony's \"High-Definition Video System\" or \"Hi-Vision\" back in the early 1990's! Back then, high definition was a little different from how it is now. The majority of the signal was analog & close to but slightly different in resolution to the 1080i picture we receive over the air today as it was 1035i (hence the large upper border in the picture). Before the earliest high-definition media was available to the public (via satellite, MUSE Laserdisc, & W-VHS tapes), Sony and other companies began shooting footage, performing research, and showing public displays of high-definition television. There were three main ways of storing HDTV (or HDVS) at that time: Reel-to-reel tape (HDV\/HDD-1000), cartridge tape (HDV-10 \"UniHi\"), & 12\" Laserdisc-style discs (HDL-5800 \/ HDL-2000). This footage came from one of the Laserdisc-style discs. These HDVS discs could only hold a maximum of 15 minutes of video on CLV discs, even less on CAV discs...but it held uncompressed, raw high-definition component video! Take that, Blu-Ray! The disc itself was produced in 1990 but some segments were taped in the 1980's. The disc contains unique footage along with recycled footage from other early Sony HD titles such as the Hills Of The Seasons series & Coral Story. An interesting note is that the older Hills of The Seasons & Coral Story sequences were recorded using the 1984-era analog HDVS system (Sony HDV-1000) while some of the other sequences, such as scenes featuring the female model, were recorded using the 1988-era digital HDVS system (Sony HDD-1000). There is a noticeable increase in random noise for the older analog HDVS sequences. The audio track is encoded in Dolby Surround\/Dolby Pro Logic (technically Dolby Stereo) so I'd highly recommend running this video through your favorite surround sound receiver! xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx This was played back on a Sony HDL-2000 Videodisc player which outputs analog component (1035i) video.

The upland forests studied were two sugar maple ecosystems that differed in overstory associates and ground flora composition, and an oak ecosystem. Three stands in each ecosystem were sampled to provide spatial replication within a 250,000 ha area in northwestern Lower Michigan. Overstory biomass and annual increment were estimated using species-specific allometric biomass equations. Net N mineralization and nitrification were determined by an in situ buried polyethylene bag technique in which surface soil samples were incubated at monthly intervals for one year. Litter was collected during autumn in each ecosystem from one randomly selected stand. Aboveground biomass was lowest in the oak ecosystem (151 t ha-1) and greatest in the sugar maple-basswood\/Osmorhiza ecosystem (209 t ha-1). Net annual N mineralization was 313 g N g-1 yr-1 in the oak ecosystem and was significantly less than annual mineralization in the two sugar maple ecosystems. Mineral N production in the sugar maple-basswood\/Osmorhiza and sugar maple-red oak\/Maianthemum ecosystems was 426 and 382 g N g-1 yr-1, respectively. Nitrification was greatest in the sugar maple-basswood\/Osmorhiza ecosystem where 85% of mineral N was oxidized to NO3- (364 g N g-1 yr-1). Nitrification was minimal in the oak forest, totaling 6% of annual mineralization (18 g N g-1 yr-1). Results suggest that ecosystem types may be used to predict spatial patterns of N transformations at regional scales.","title":"Spatial and temporal variability of nitrogen cycling in northern Lower Michigan"},{"date":"1990-06-10T00:00:00Z","identifier":"zakonczenie-programu-tp1-06.10.1990r.","subject":"VHS","description":"Zako\u0144czenie Programu - TP1- (06.10.1990r.)","title":"Zako\u0144czenie Programu - TP1 - (06.10.1990r.)"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"zakonodatelstvoo0000unse","subject":["Trade regulation -- Soviet Union","Commercial law -- Soviet Union","Industrial laws and legislation -- Soviet Union","Business enterprises -- Law and legislation -- Soviet Union","Labor laws and legislation -- Soviet Union"],"description":["398 p. ; 22 cm","Includes bibliographical references (p. 388-[389])"],"title":"Zakonodatel\u02b9stvo o torgovle : nastol\u02b9nai\ufe20a\ufe21 kniga rukovoditeli\ufe20a\ufe21 torgovogo predprii\ufe20a\ufe21tii\ufe20a\ufe21"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"zamboni0000grav","subject":["Magic","Hockey stories"],"description":["90 p. : 18 cm","Un jeune gardien de but de\u0301couvre gra\u0302ce a\u0300 une machine a\u0300 re\u0302ver et a\u0300 remonter le temps dans la zamboni, qu'il est lui-me\u0302me la machine a\u0300 re\u0302ver de son pe\u0300re.

Researching such national security establishment abuses as domestic and foreign political assassinations, and governmental complicity with organized crime and drug smuggling syndicates, Mr. Emory has distilled his academic research into an archival documentary format. These \u201carchive\u201d programs consist of excerpts from printed sources read during his broadcasts. \u00a0 Mr. Emory\u2019s programs have been featured on a regular basis on Pacifica stations KPFK (Los Angeles) and WBAI (New York), and many smaller stations. He has appeared as guest on major commercial stations including KGO-AM (San Francisco) and WLUP-AM (Chicago) and as an expert commentator on broadcast outlets in three continents. Audio cassette copies of the archive programs are also circulated internationally. \u00a0 Mr. Emory began his work during the Watergate era when he noted numerous connections between that scandal and the assassination of President Kennedy. Pursuing his work on the JFK assassination, Mr. Emory discovered Nazi General Reinhard Gehlen\u2019s Eastern front spy apparatus, and its incorporation into the CIA after World War II. This led Mr. Emory to study the origins of fascism and its influence on the contemporary world. Mr. Emory graduated from Amherst College with a B.A. in psychology.

Perspective Top-down Sport Football (European) \/ Soccer Genre Sports Misc Licensed Visual 2D scrolling Description Adidas Championship Football is a soccer game with 24 national teams. The only playing mode is a championship which mimics the World Cup with randomly drawn groups. A second player can control a second team. The playing perspective is top-down with a scrolling field. The control method is an expanded dribbling method known from the Kick Off series.

Using a heavy-designed machine with a V6 DOHC 3000CC Twin Turbo Engine, five sets of nitro-fuel boosts, and a gun attached to the steering wheel (which you can use to damage the target vehicle), your mission is to patrol the streets and find these vehicles. The gameplay is similar to Chase H.Q. , but there are a few differences. For example, cars travel in both directions instead of one, and some of them will catch up to your car and shoot at you. At least once in every stage a helicopter does a fly by and drops you some grenades you can use to further damage the target vehicle. A guy on a motorcycle will catch up to you and throw grenades at your car. And, most importantly, as mentioned earlier, you can shoot at the target vehicle rather than just bumping into it. Have fun driving around, but remember, there is a strict time limit, so I wouldn't waste time or keep crashing into things if I were you. From Mobygames.com. Original Entry","title":"Chase H.Q.

By 2022, the game was played not by humans, but two teams of seven robots. To spice things up, the usual pig skin ball was replaced with a 350 pound bomb. Cyberball brings this fast and furious action to life. Gameplay is essentially the same as the real sport, although the 'downs' are replaced by the bomb's heat gradually increasing towards 'critical'. After this it will explode and possession will be swapped. This is prevented when you cross the 50-yard line, lose possession or score a touchdown, in which cases it resets to 'cool'. Field goals and punts are not featured - the only kick is the initial kick-off you receive. Control passes from the quarterback (thrower) to the intended catcher as soon as a pass is released. The two-player game is co-operative - on offense one player passes and the other receives. From Mobygames.com.

While searching it, he eventually finds an escape shuttle sitting in the launch bay, only to discover that it is out of fuel. He returns to the satellite in an attempt to find some. The fuel cans are scattered around the five levels of the ship, which Dan can get to by using the Mekon's teleporters. To get to them though, Dan needs to destroy any Treen that gets in his way using a variety of weapons, brought by using a computer terminal.

Technically impressive, it featured three screens depicting the largest playfield seen in a game so far (the same system was employed for Ninja Warriors ), with the player sitting atop a big set of loudspeakers. Visually and audibly, it was a league above Irem's and Konami's offerings. When Taito (and others) ported the game to home machines, they were forced to shrink the playfield to fit in one single screen, and re-dubbed it Darius Plus . The plot of Darius involves the two heroes Proco Jr. and Tiat Young fighting the menaces posed by galactic fish and other sea animals again their homeworld. What sets Darius apart from other shoot'em-ups of the time is its way of letting the player choose his path with a certain amount of freedom. At the end of each area (level), you are able to choose between one of two worlds which the area branches into. This renders a higher replay value, since there are many paths to reach the end of the game by. Apart from this, the gameplay is on the simplistic side, both due to unimaginative attack waves and little interaction with the surroundings, but mainly due to the very basic powerup system, which is nowhere near the complexity of the aforementioned R-Type's and Gradius' .

If you mentally change the driver names, it can be thought of as a recreation of real NASCAR racing rather than a direct recreation of the film. You play Cruise's Cole Trickle character (his name, like many of the others, is slightly different to that of a real NASCAR racer of the day) against your rivals on 8 tracks, based on real-life counterparts. The races are all on ovals, although the exact lengths, corner types and gradients are varied. This means that the ideal racing line on one track can put you into the wall on another. Qualifying is incorporated alongside the races themselves. From times to times you'll have to pull into the pit stop area. When doing so, you control the five members of the pit crew. Loosing time on pit will make you lose positions at the race. The other racers, however, never pit. The NES version has 3rd-Person perspective only. From Mobygames.com.

You will encounter different types of blocks that will help or hinder you. These include Question blocks, get it right and you can move on, get it wrong and you have to answer another question meaning you slowly scroll towards the left of the screen. Money can also be collected to help stack up your total at the end of the level. Other blocks include a block that will block you for a certain time and a block that moves you in a random direction. When you reach the Win bar you enter a bonus game where on a time limit you have to answer as a number of questions based on how many coins you collected.

Perspective Top-down Genre Action, Racing \/ Driving Description Hot Rod is a top-view racing game influenced by Super Sprint , in which three miniature cars race to complete a race as quickly as possible, by rotating, accelerating and braking at the right moments. You start with limited fuel, but more can be collected as you cover the track. Hitting hazards can cause your car to explode, thus costing time as it is replaced. Unusually the racetracks are linear rather than lap-based, so each round involves covering a section of track once. After each race, you can purchase upgrades at the shop, depending on how much money you earned in the previous race. Only part of the circuit is shown at a time, and this scrolls following the leader. If you fail to keep up with this, your car is moved forward on the track, with a penalty fuel deduction. This is slightly similar to the system later used in head-to-head games of Micro Machines , and is especially punishing while you are on roads travelling horizontally and the leading CPU car is travelling vertically, as it makes the margin for error much smaller.

But the nightmare had still not finished, because a few miles away, in the town of his cousin Ope, \"Cococastle\" (a place crowned by a phantasmagoric Castle), it was happening a strange phenomena. All the indications made think that a \"coco\", survivor of \"Cocovillage\", had converted the Castle into his dwelling, establishing in addition a maleficent alliance with the sinister inhabitants from that place. The terror had seized the inhabitants of \"Cococastle\", and only Mad can give back the tranquillity to the pacific inhabitants of this village. The game consists in eating all the \"coconuts\" (small ball species that are dispersed through all the Castle) which appear at every moment. Once you have finished with all the coconuts of the level you will pass to the following stay of the Castle of the Ghosts, this is the mechanic until you have been able to explore all its corners. However, you shouldn't care only in eating all the \"coconuts\", but in addition you will have to be very kind trying to not collide with any of the inhabitants of the terrific Castle, as well as to avoid the different traps (or using them in your own benefit) while taking helpful -some with really curious effects- objects.

The pieces are offered in random order, and there are seven different types - straight lines going horizontally or vertically, corners rotating in each of the four directions, and cross-over pieces which carry the flooz straight across horizontally and vertically. Each of these can be entered from either side. When the flooz hits a gap, or a piece which the previous piece can't flow into, the pipe is finished. Before the flooz starts flowing from its randomly-selected starting position, the player has several seconds to start placing pieces. They can be put down anywhere.

The pieces are offered in random order, and there are seven different types - straight lines going horizontally or vertically, corners rotating in each of the four directions, and cross-over pieces which carry the flooz straight across horizontally and vertically. Each of these can be entered from either side. When the flooz hits a gap, or a piece which the previous piece can't flow into, the pipe is finished.

Released 1990 Platform ZX Spectrum Published by Ocean Software Ltd. Genre Action Setting Sci-Fi \/ Futuristic Gameplay Platform, Puzzle elements, Shooter Misc Licensed Perspective 1st-person, Side view Visual 2D scrolling Narrative Crime Description RoboCop 2 for the Spectrum offers the same mixture of gameplay styles as Ocean Software's other versions of the game: platforming action, a puzzle mode and a shooting gallery, but with substantial differences in level design and gameplay mechanics. The bulk of the game consists of the platform sections. In each level, RoboCop must reach a certain goal: destroying the Nuke drug factory, finding and destroying a Nuke cache and finally, defeating the criminal Cain. The levels are many screens high and wide and additionally consist of two sections connected by doors. Enemies regularly appear attempting to destroy Robo. He can dispatch them with his gun, which can be upgraded to either a three-way or a scatter shot via power-ups. These fall from the top of the screen randomly and must be shot to activate them. Besides weapon upgrades, there is baby food for restoring health, clocks for increasing the time limit and a shield that gives temporary invulnerability. Negative power-ups also exist and should be avoided, as they can decrease time or energy. A question mark power-up also exists, which might have any effect, negative or positive. All platform sections involve puzzle elements. Switches must be found to activate lifts or drain vats and opening certain doors requires completing a sequence of numbers. In the second level (the brewery) care must be taken to avoid drops of beer. If hit, Robo gets drunk and the controls get reversed. The effect wears off after a time and can also be canceled out by a second drop. Only in the first level, some of the enemies must be arrested, not shot. A flashing prompt indicates such a case. Robo must walk into the enemy to arrest him: accidentally shooting him will drain time from the clock. After every platform level, a puzzle level follows. To regain Robo's lost memories, a cursor must be moved over a circuit board with the goal of hitting all yellow chips while avoiding all red ones. Moving the cursor leaves a trail of burnt circuitry which must not be crossed again. It is possible to re-arrange the board by shifting the current row left or right or the current column up or down. Four boards must be completed successfully within 150 seconds to gain extra lives. After the puzzle mode, the shooting gallery follows. Targets will appear in the windows of two buildings and all criminals holding guns should be shot while all unarmed civilians should be spared. Good performance in the gallery improves the power of RoboCop's gun for the following platform level. From Mobygames.com.

Perspective Side view Genre Action Gameplay Arcade, Beat 'em up \/ Brawler Visual 2D scrolling Description Ninja Gaiden begins with a cinematic animation in which two ninjas duel to the death; one goes down. It is revealed that the doomed ninja is the father of Ryu Hayabusa. When Ryu learns of this, he embarks on a quest to find out who killed his father and why. This quest takes him to America to find an archaeologist with whom Ryu's father was working. From there, Ryu becomes embroiled in an evil, supernatural conspiracy involving a villain named Jaquio who has plans to use an ancient castle and some relics to unleash a terrifying evil upon the world. In comparison to the better known console version this game is a traditional fighting game similar to Double Dragon in which the player walks from left to right while battling numerous enemies. Only if all foes are dispatched of, the player can advance in the level. It's also possible to perform special attacks and use weapons. The latter are either collectable power-ups or environmental objects like phone boots. Ryu can attack his enemies using his his bare hands and feet or using a sword (for a limited time). He can also perform moves such as a flying neck throw, a back flip and hang kicks, performed while hanging in scenario objects. Throwing enemies against objects such as phone cabins, oil drums or dumpsters will destroy them, revealing power ups such as health items and swords. At some points, Ryu will have to perform acrobatic moves to carry on. He has a life bar starting with five units. The game takes place in United States' locations such as Las Vegas, North Carolina, Los Angeles, the Grand Canyon and Brooklyn. The enemies in those stages are mostly of the same five kinds, including Jason Vorhees' look-alikes and other masked men. There is a boss fight at the end of each stage. A two-player co-operative game is also featured. Whenever the player dies, a continue screen will appear showing Ryu chained to a table while a circular saw descends upon him. From Mobygames.com.

Perspective Side view Genre Action Gameplay Arcade, Beat 'em up \/ Brawler Visual 2D scrolling Description Ninja Gaiden begins with a cinematic animation in which two ninjas duel to the death; one goes down. It is revealed that the doomed ninja is the father of Ryu Hayabusa. When Ryu learns of this, he embarks on a quest to find out who killed his father and why. This quest takes him to America to find an archaeologist with whom Ryu's father was working. From there, Ryu becomes embroiled in an evil, supernatural conspiracy involving a villain named Jaquio who has plans to use an ancient castle and some relics to unleash a terrifying evil upon the world. In comparison to the better known console version this game is a traditional fighting game similar to Double Dragon in which the player walks from left to right while battling numerous enemies. Only if all foes are dispatched of, the player can advance in the level. It's also possible to perform special attacks and use weapons. The latter are either collectable power-ups or environmental objects like phone boots. Ryu can attack his enemies using his his bare hands and feet or using a sword (for a limited time). He can also perform moves such as a flying neck throw, a back flip and hang kicks, performed while hanging in scenario objects. Throwing enemies against objects such as phone cabins, oil drums or dumpsters will destroy them, revealing power ups such as health items and swords. At some points, Ryu will have to perform acrobatic moves to carry on. He has a life bar starting with five units. The game takes place in United States' locations such as Las Vegas, North Carolina, Los Angeles, the Grand Canyon and Brooklyn. The enemies in those stages are mostly of the same five kinds, including Jason Vorhees' look-alikes and other masked men. There is a boss fight at the end of each stage. A two-player co-operative game is also featured. Whenever the player dies, a continue screen will appear showing Ryu chained to a table while a circular saw descends upon him. From Mobygames.com.

The main character is Bobo, an inmate who has been sentenced for seventeen years. He must do many chores, such as peeling potatoes, ladling soup to his fellow prisoners, helping his fellow prisoners to escape, jumping electric wires and singing lullabies to his snoring cell mates. It is possible to play through the events in a sequence or one at a time. Up to six players (alternating, not simultaneously) can play this game. Each event can be played with joystick or keyboard. The specific moves you have to make vary from event to event but it come basically down to moving the joystick or keyboard keys fast from left to right. It is also possible to pick things up and toss them. The game includes the following events: Bobo has a job in the prisons canteen. He must serve soup to the other inmates and keep their soup plates full. To do this Bobo must move around the tables. When his supply of soup is empty he must refill it at the top of the screen where a new supply of soup is available. If his fellow inmates demand more soup they start banging and hammering on the tables. The score of this event is based on how many plates of soup he hands out. Peeling potatoes is not Bobo's favorite chore but he has to do it. He has to pick up a potato, then peeling it and when that's done tossing it away. Bobo scores points based on the number of potatoes he has peeled. If a potato is not fully peeled it will be tossed back. In the next event Bobo must help his inmates to escape prison. The inmates are jumping out of their cell windows and it is Bobo's task to get them over the prison wall by moving a trampoline around. The score is based on how many inmates actually can escape. Bobo must be sure to catch the inmates under the right angle with his trampoline because if he fails the inmates will crash into the prison wall. Finally, Bobo found an way to escape prison. He must jump from wire to wire and as the wires are electrified he must take care not to be electrocuted. The score in this event based on how long Bobo can prevent being electrocuted. Bonus points can be earned by picking up the green objects that appear occasionally on the wires. In the last event Bobo has been captured by the police and returned to his cell. He can't sleep because his cell mates are snoring and to stop it he has to sing lullabies to them. He has to climb the beds and not wake his cell mates by stumbling around his cell. When all cell mates fall asleep Bobo himself must go to bed to get some rest himself. The score in this event is based on the time Bobo is actually able to sleep himself. From Mobygames.com.

Geometric shapes randomly generated from 7 basic kinds fall from the top to the bottom. The aim is to form these shapes into coherent horizontal 1,2,3 or 4-lines so they will disappear. This mode offer various rates of falling shapes. Also, it's possible to switch on another 7 special kinds of shapes. Second mode is much more interesting. There is 99 different rounds prepared. Almost each round is partly filled with some diagram created by particular shapes (which of course increases difficulty of the game). Every round contains objective(s) to complete. 3 kinds of objectives does exist - \"Fulfill Your Quota\", \"Destroy All Bricks\" and \"Survive xx Seconds\". If you'll fail, you're advancing to the next round with loss of 1 life. But no worries, each 5th round is bonus and you can obtain extra life. As well as the first mode it's possible to play with 7 basic kinds of shapes or with 7 basic+7 special kinds of shapes. From Mobygames.com.
