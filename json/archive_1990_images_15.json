Indeed, throughout its history, the organization has championed some decidedly unpopular causes, including free speech rights for racist groups and due process for even the most vicious criminals. But as Samuel Walker argues in his provocative new book--the first comprehensive history of the ACLU--the organization has played a leading role in shaping principles of individual freedom that are now a cornerstone of American law and the way all of us conceive of personal liberty. It has been involved in most of the Supreme Court's landmark cases expanding individual rights, and today argues more cases before the Court than anyone but the federal government. In fact, as American Liberties makes clear, the organization has played a central role in creating that mythical American \"mainstream\" that its opponents so often invoke. In fascinating detail, Walker recounts the ACLU's stormy history since its founding in 1920 to fight for free speech. He explores its involvement in some of the most famous causes in American history, including the Scopes \"Monkey Trial,\" the internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II, the Cold War anti-Communist witch hunts, and the civil rights movement. And he examines its most famous personalities, such as its puritan and autocratic founder Roger Baldwin; Felix Frankfurter, a long-time member who later voted against many ACLU cases while a Supreme Court justice; and Morris Ernst, who won the landmark case involving James Joyce's Ulysses and led the ACLU to take up the cause of free expression for sexually-frank publications. Walker deals candidly with the ACLU's less praiseworthy episodes--such as the expulsion of Elizabeth Gurley Flynn from the Board during the ACLU's anti-Communist phase, and he dissects the organization's constant struggle within itself to define the proper scope of civil liberties, revealing facts that will surprise even members of the ACLU","Includes bibliographical references (pages 449-452) and index","ACLU, civil liberties, and American life: Revolution in American life -- What is the ACLU? -- What is a civil liberty?

Dr. K.S. Lal has documented in some fulness how the continued wars of conquest waged by the Islamic invaders ensured a constant supply of Hindu prisoners of war who were sold and resold as slaves and who eventually ended up by feeding the Muslim population. It may sound cruel but the Theology of Islam does prescribe capture and enslavement of non-combatant men, women and children of the infidels as a part of the legitimate booty promised by Allah to those who fight for enforcing his commandments. The history of Islam is replete with this practice. On the other hand, Dr. Lal examines in some detail and refutes conclusively the oft-repeated theory that the Hindu caste system was responsible for conversions to Islam. He points out that the countries in the Middle East, Central Asia and North Africa had no caste system and yet they succumbed completely to the onslaught of Islam.

After much speculation over covert U.S. action in the Indonesian drama, this book records with authority and candor precisely what the U.S. did and did not do. Beginning in 1965, as the Vietnam war intensified, a series of dramatic events occurred in Indonesia leading to the collapse of Indonesia's Communist Party (then the world's third largest), the removal of the flamboyant, pro-Communist President Sukarno, and his replacement by President Suharto who has provided over twenty-five years of sound leadership. The U.S. and its friends had an enormous stake in the outcome of the Indonesian crisis, but the U.S. wisely exercised restraint despite attacks on its Embassy and Consulates. This fast-paced, lucid account, written with humor and human concern by one of America's most talented and experienced diplomats and illustrated with photos of key moments, captures the drama and significance of these events. Former Assistant Secretary of State William Bundy's foreword testifies from the Washington perspective to the author's courage and wisdom in action","Includes index","1. The Setting -- 2.

The guide is divided into five sections. In the first three sections, nationally recognized experts approach the question of how caregivers can nurture early social and emotional growth. Concerning the developing self, papers in section 1 discuss temperaments of and emotional development in infants and toddlers. Dwelling on the development of social skills, section 2 presents papers on creating nurturing relationships with infants and toddlers, and on self-esteem, security, and social competence. Section 3, on guidance, includes a paper on socialization, guidance, and discipline with infants and toddlers. The papers in each section are followed by related information from research and practice; concrete examples are given of caregiver actions that support growth. Section 4 contains examples of appropriate and inappropriate caregiving behavior in the areas of social-emotional growth and socialization. The concluding section 5 directs the reader to additional readings and appropriate audiovisual materials. (RH)","Practitioners","Teachers"],"title":"Social-Emotional Growth and Socialization.

A comprehensive IS plan should provide a coordinated approach to strategic business goals, organizational information requirements and an overall measure of performance. Acknowledging the importance of comprehensive planning in the process of managing the organization's information resource, a collection of methodologies has been accumulated, to serve in carrying out the IS planning effort. However, a managerial problem that often arises is how to make the best use of current planning methodologies. The purpose of this thesis is to survey the existing methodologies, establish a framework for analyzing the IS planning methodologies, and examine some of their advantages and limitations.","title":"Information systems planning methodologies: a framework for comparison and selection"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"informationsysteunse_3","description":"USA","title":"Information Systems"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"informationtechn0000grif","subject":["Electronic data processing","Computers","Computer sciences"],"description":"xii, 164 pages : 28 cm","title":"Information technology in context"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"informationtechn0000ifip","subject":["Electronic data processing -- Developing countries -- Congresses","Information technology -- Developing countries -- Congresses","Electronic data processing","Information technology","Developing countries","Developing countries Computer systems"],"description":["viii, 283 pages : 23 cm","Includes bibliographical references"],"title":"Information technology in developing countries : proceedings of the IFIP TC9\/TC8 Working Conference on the Impact of Information Systems on Developing Countries, New Delhi, India, 24-26 November 1988"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"informationtechn0000nort","title":"Information technology and management awareness : open systems"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"informationtechn0000unse_e9e0","subject":["Electronic data processing -- Management","Information technology"],"description":["471 p. : 24 cm","Includes bibliographical references"],"title":"Information technology resources utilization and management : issues and trends"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"informationtechn0000unse_j2v2","subject":["Information technology -- Economic aspects -- Singapore -- Congresses","Information technology -- Social aspects -- Singapore -- Congresses"],"description":["xii, 136, p. : 30 cm","Includes bibliographical references"],"title":"Information technology and Singapore society : trends, policies, and applications : symposium proceedings"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"informationtechn0000unse_k6c2","subject":["Information technology -- Study and teaching -- Great Britain","Education -- Data processing","Children with disabilities -- Education -- Great Britain","Children with disabilities -- Education","Information technology -- Study and teaching","E\u0301ducation et informatique","Enfants handicape\u0301s -- E\u0301ducation -- Grande-Bretagne","Enfants en difficulte\u0301 d'apprentissage -- Grande-Bretagne","Great Britain","Special education Use of Information technology"],"description":"vii, 35 pages ;

It demonstrates that culture, as the primary source of the policy-maker's epistemology, is an essential determinant of the outputs of the strategic planning process. Culture has this effect because strategic planning is nothing more than collection of considered judgments made through the perceptual lens created by one's own culture. The study looks at the components of culture: how and why it forms, is maintained, and changes in support of a specific group's internal integration and external adaptation functions. Through this effort, culture is exposed as a primary cause of individual and collective behavior. As such, it is presented as a principal source of data for understanding and explaining national behavior in the international environment. Concurrently, the study shows that strategic planning, as a fundamentally value-laden process, is highly susceptible to the negative effects of a perspective biased by the planner's own acculturation. Therefore, the subjects of ethnocentrism and cultural relativism are examined. This study also investigates the concepts of strategic culture and national style, in turn, is presented as an artifact of the strategic culture. Finally, a strategic behavior model is presented and briefly tested to demonstrate the methodological linkage between strategic-cultural assumptions and specific security behavior.","title":"In the mind's eye : cultural influence in defense analysis and strategic planning"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"inmirodistrict00tayl","description":"The captain's son -- The instruction of a mistress -- The throughway -- The hand of Emmagene -- Daphne's lover -- Her need -- Three heroines -- In the Miro District","title":"In the Miro district"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"inmirror0000cowl","subject":["Mirrors","Readers (Primary)","Mirrors -- Juvenile fiction"],"description":"8 pages : 17 cm","title":"In the mirror"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"inmo-papers","subject":["India","mathematics"],"description":"Papers relating to Indian National Mathematics Olympiad. 1989","title":"INMO Papers"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"inmoonlightwaiti0000carr","subject":["Sheep -- Fiction","Farm life -- Fiction"],"description":["[32] p. : 16 x 19 cm","In the spring during lambing time, a family wakes in the middle of the night to welcome Clover the sheep's new baby"],"title":"In the moonlight, waiting"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"inmos-ansi-c-toolset-reference-manual","subject":["INMOS","ANSI C","Manual","Transputer","Toolset"],"description":"INMOS\u00a0 ANSI C toolset reference manual Transputer INMOS Limited","title":"INMOS ANSI C Toolset Reference Manual (1990)"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"inmos-ansi-c-toolset-user-manual","subject":["INMOS","TRANSPUTER","ANSI C","TOOLSET","MANUAL"],"description":"INMOS\u00a0 ANSI C toolset user manual transputer INMOS Limited","title":"INMOS ANSI C Toolset User Manual"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"inmos-d-7205-a-occam-2-toolset-720k","subject":["INMOS","OCCAM 2","TOOLSET","TRANSPUTER"],"description":"INMOS D7205A OCCAM 2 Toolset on Seven 720K floppy disks.\u00a0\u00a0","title":"INMOS - D7205A - OCCAM 2 TOOLSET 720K DISKS"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"inmos-ims-d-7214-c-ansi-c-toolset-720-k","subject":["INMOS","TRANSPUTER","ANSI C","D7214C"],"description":"INMOS IMS D7214C Disk Set on 720K IBM Floppy Disk ANSI C Toolkit These disks were accompanied by this manual .\u00a0 The 360K version of these disks are here. \u00a0 \u00a0","title":"INMOS IMS D7214C ANSI C TOOLSET 720K DISKS"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"inmos-ims-d-7214-c-ansi-c-toolset-disk-1","subject":["INMOS","Transputer","Codemist Limited","Perihelion Software"],"description":"IMS D7214C Disk Set on 360K IBM Floppy Disk ANSI C Toolkit These disks were accompanied by this manual.\u00a0 \u00a0 The 720K 3.5\" disks have been uploaded here .\u00a0 \u00a0","title":"INMOS IMS D7214C ANSI C Toolset on 360K Disks"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"inmybathroom0000thom","subject":["Cleanliness -- Juvenile fiction","Swine -- Juvenile fiction","Bathrooms -- Fiction","Cleanliness -- Fiction","Pigs -- Fiction","Swine"],"description":["19 unnumbered pages : 21 cm","A young pig describes his activities in the bathroom as he cleans himself before going to bed","\"First published in Great Britain by Julia MacRae Books ...

The book represents the foundation of Nishida's philosophy, which reflects both his deep study of Zen Buddhism and his thorough analysis of Western philosophy. In this important new translation, two scholars -- one Japanes and one American -- have worked together to present a lucid and accurate rendition of this basic work. They have also included an enlightening introduction and ample notes to aid the Western reader. Nishida sets forth the notion of \"pure experience\"--The concept that pure, or direct, experience precedes the separation of subject and object and is true reality. He next considers reality, investigating its relation to thinking, volition, and intuition. The Good, which Nishida considered to be the realization of our internal demands or ideals, is analyzed in the light of the nature of reality and pure experience. In conclusion, Nishida suggests a theory of God as the unifier of the universe and the universe as an expression of God. Throughout he touches upon the work of Western philosophers such as Kant, Hegel, Fichte, William James, and John Dewey in order to explicate his ideas\"--Front flap","Translation of: Zen no kenky\u016b","Originally published in Japanese by Iwanami Shoten, Publishers, Tokyo\"--Title page verso","Includes bibliographical references (pages 177-179) and index","Pure experience -- Reality -- The Good -- Religion"],"title":"An inquiry into the good"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"inquisitionsocie0000hali","subject":["Inquisition -- Spain -- Valencia (Province) -- History","Valencia (Spain : Province) -- Church history"],"description":["viii, 444 p. : 24 cm","Includes bibliographical references (p. 423-428) and index"],"title":"Inquisition and society in the kingdom of Valencia, 1478-1834"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"inreallife0000orde","subject":["1.

It ceased publication in 1990. I have 19 of its old issues which I have scanned and I share here. All are in PDF format with OCR. All ads are removed. I have included 2 short reviews also. Do write in your comments. All its issues are also available in a 3 DVD set. \"Born from the rubble of the defunct Player\u2019s Chess News, Inside Chess grew to prominence in a world quite different from the one we now inhabit.\u00a0 Remember that there was no Internet in 1988.\u00a0 There was no Mark Crowther \u2013 who really should set up a subscription service to let his fans support his work! \u2013 to bring us new games on a daily and weekly basis at The Week in Chess.\u00a0 Chessbase was a mere toy.\u00a0 In such days there was still room for a bi-weekly magazine that would cover recent events from a near-insider perspective.\u00a0 A lag of a couple of weeks between game played and annotations published was not cause for alarm; if Seirawan\u2019s wonderful annotations are any indication, it might have been preferable. The magazine\u2019s main publishers were Yasser Seirawan and John Donaldson.\u00a0 It\u2019s hard to think of two people better suited for such a task.\u00a0 Seirawan, of course, was a World Junior Champion, a World Championship candidate, and a second for Kortchnoi and Timman in World Championship matches.\u00a0 He was also deeply involved in chess politics, having run for USCF President, worked on the GMA, and authored the \u2018Prague Agreement\u2019 that sought to heal the dual world champions schism of the early 00s.\u00a0 Donaldson, while \u2018only\u2019 (ha!) an IM, has served as Captain of the US Olympic team and is a eminent author, historian and theoretician.\u00a0 He is currently the director of the Mechanics Institute Chess Club. For large chunks of its history, Chess Life and Review was provincial, very slow to report on international events, and aimed at a very low readership in terms of skill. There was no internet though, and it had something pretty close to a monopoly in the United States, so strong club players (and up) were stuck. We could get the Informant twice a year (pretty late), and some lucky few of us could occasionally get photocopies of tournament bulletins Walter Browne would bring from overseas. It was this vacuum that Yasser Seirawan's Inside Chess filled in a wonderful way from 1988 to 2000. For most of its run, the magazine came out every two weeks, and it included tournament reports from all over the world, with a special focus on super-tournaments. Sometimes Seirawan himself was a participant in those tournaments, but whether he was or not the reports were timely, colorful, and full of games commented on by the man himself. As an elite grandmaster, he certainly knew what he was talking about, and what was even better was his commentary style. In the end, of course, Inside Chess could not compete as a bi-weekly.\u00a0 They tried to continue as a bigger monthly, but as Seirawan wrote in IC 12:6, \u201c[the Internet] fills our original niche better than Inside Chess or any magazine possibly could. \u2026 The Internet is a powerful competitor, delivering chess news quickly and in massive amounts.\u201d\u00a0 Inside Chess tried to continue as an online-only ezine, but without any advertising income or subscriber base, it could not but fail.\" Inside Chess - Vol.2,No.25-26 (25-Dec-1989) 5,062 KB Inside Chess - Vol.3,No.1 (22-Jan-1990) 3,626 KB Inside Chess - Vol.3,No.2 (5-Feb-1990) \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 3,709 KB Inside Chess - Vol.3,No.3 (19-Feb-1990) 3,324 KB Inside Chess - Vol.3,No.4 (5-March-1990) 3,220 KB Inside Chess - Vol.3,No.5 (19-March-1990) 2,622 KB Inside Chess - Vol.3,No.6 (2-April-1990) 3,425 KB Inside Chess - Vol.5,No.7 (13-April-1992) 3,035 KB Inside Chess - Vol.5,No.ll (8-June-1992) 2,601 KB Inside Chess - Vol.5,No.13 (6-July-1992) 3,098 KB Inside Chess - Vol.5,No.14 (20-July-1992) 4,458 KB Inside Chess - Vol.5,No.15 (3-Aug-1992) 3,043 KB Inside Chess - Vol.5,No.16 (17-Aug-1992) 2,788 KB Inside Chess - Vol.5,No.17 (31-Aig-1992) 2,501 KB Inside Chess - Vol.5,No.18 (14-Septt-1992) 2,651 KB Inside Chess - Vol.5,No.20 (12-Oct-1992) 2,315 KB Inside Chess - Vol.6,No.3 (22-Feb-1993) 2,709 KB Inside Chess - Vol.6,No.4 (8-March-1993) 2,423 KB Inside Chess - Vol.6,No.7 (19-April-1993) 2,353 KB","title":"Inside Chess Magazine 19 Issues"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"inside-dos-tips-techniques-for-ms-dos-and-pc-dos-journal-magazine-1990-1994","subject":["MS-DOS","Magazine","Journal"],"description":"Title(s):Inside DOS : tips & techniques for MS-DOS and PC-DOS.Publication Start Year:1990Frequency:MonthlyCountry of Publication:United StatesPublisher:Louisville, KY : The Cobb Group, c1990-Language:English","title":"Inside DOS: tips & techniques for MS-DOS and PC-DOS Journal Magazine 1990-1994"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"inside-edition-elvis-presley-1992","subject":["Bill O'Reilly","Deborah Norville"],"description":"Syndicated broadcast","title":"Inside Edition - Bill O'Reilly, Deborah Norville"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"inside-wrestling-1990-01-flair-sting","subject":["Various Wrestling Magazines","magazines","1990","wrestling","wrestlers","wrestling magazines","professional wrestling","magazines--1990","Inside Wrestling Magazine","Stanley Weston","Bill Apter","Apter mag","World Wrestling Federation (WWF)","National Wrestling Alliance (NWA)","American Wrestling Association (AWA)","defunct magazines","Survivor Series","Terry Funk","Ricky Morton","Robert Gibson","Dennis Condrey","Rock 'N' Roll Express","Hulk Hogan","Stan Hansen","Sting","Ric Flair","Jake 'the Snake' Roberts","Ted DiBiase","Jerry Lawler","Sgt.

I quote Kurt himself, as mentioned in the Don't Be Afraid Data CD section of his old website: This is the program I made (with help from Robert Olivier of the Spectre Organisation (tm) for HACK. I did it in the summer of 1990. It too was supposed to have been distributed as a promotional item for HACK. It was never produced however, because someone at Warner Bros. said \"Shouldn't it be for Mac?\". I made all the animations myself, using Autodesk Animator. To use it, unzip the file into its own directory, and then run \"InSoc90.exe\" from within a full-screen DOS window. NOTE: The audio features of the program play through the PC speaker, not your sound card. (No one had sound cards yet, then.) This can produce some VERY unpleasant sounds on some modern systems. It worked on any computer I could find in 1990, but now it's not so reliable. The zip file was also available for download at the website, and I plucked it from a very early Wayback Archive capture to repost it here. To use this, simply unzip the contents of the zip into a folder and run InSoc90.exe. The program will play back a few animations, and you can learn a bit about the band and see some photos. Oh and the car, too. Just a little warning though, the music clips sound really bad in DOSBox. Like, ear screechingly bad. Please don't think the actual songs sound that bad. They don't.

There exists a large literature on this subject in which solutions, bifurcations, fronts, and the dynamical stability of these objects are discussed. To the uninitiated reader, the theoretical methods that lead to the various results often seem somewhat ad hoc, and it is not clear how to generalize them to the nextthat is, not yet solvedproblem. In an introduction to the subject of instabilities in spatially infinite systems, Pierre Collet and Jean-Pierre Eckmann aim to give a systematic account of these methods, and to work out the relevant features that make them operational. The book examines in detail a number of model equations from physics. The mathematical developments of the subject are based on bifurcation theory and on the theory of invariant manifolds. These are combined to give a coherent description of several problems in which instabilities occur, notably the Eckhaus instability and the formation of fronts in the Swift-Hohenberg equation. These phenomena can appear only in infinite systems, and this book breaks new ground as a systematic account of the mathematics connected with infinite space domains. Originally published in 1990.

The use of classical techniques coupled with the local stationarity assumption is met with only moderate success. Of the many time frequency distribution functions used in the signal analysis, none present fully satisfactory spectra. The performance of the spectrogram, Instantaneous Power Spectra (IPS) the Wigner-Ville Distribution (WD) and various aspects of the Rihaczek distribution (RD) for a variety of signal nonstationarities are compared. WD has the most narrow main-lobes but suffers from spectral cross-terms. IPS, the real part of the RD consistently shows a broadened main-lobe without cross-terms. The squared magnitude of the RD places sharp peaks along the crest of the main-lobe and is otherwise very similar to IPS. The imaginary part of the RD shows a sensitivity to discontinuous frequency changes i.e., frequency shift keying.","title":"Instantaneous Power Spectrum"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"instantartforbib0000unse","subject":["Bible -- Study and teaching -- Juvenile literature","Bible -- Study and teaching","Bible","Bible games and puzzles","Education"],"description":"46 pages","title":"Instant art for Bible themes worksheets.

One approach that shows particular promise is rapid prototyping. Rapid prototyping is the use of executable models of a software system to firm up the requirements before a significant amount of time and effort has been invested in implementation. The computer aided prototyping system (CAPS) is a rapid prototyping system that automates many of the manual processes of prototyping, thus allowing for quicker prototype construction and even further cost savings. Within CAPS there exists an execution support system. The purpose of the execution support system is to take the description of a prototype written in the prototyping language PSDL and to convert this into an executable prototype which can then be shown to the user. Previous research resulted in separate implementations for the components of the execution support system, but these components were never integrated into a functioning system. It is the development of this tool which is the subject of this thesis.","title":"Integration of the execution support system for the Computer-Aided Prototyping System (CAPS)"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"integrationofphy0000hump","subject":["Physical education for children -- Curricula -- United States","Education, Elementary -- Curricula -- United States"],"description":["xi, 204 p. ; 26 cm","Includes bibliographical references (p. 199-200) and index"],"title":"Integration of physical education in the elementary school curriculum"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"integrationofwom0000rizz","subject":["Women","Personnel management","Organizational change","Women executives","Frau","Fu\u0308hrungskra\u0308fteauswahl","Personalentwicklung","Weibliche Fu\u0308hrungskraft","Managers Women"],"description":["Includes bibliographical references and indexes","Views of women -- Demystifying the status of women -- Views of women : gender comparisons and feminist perspectives -- Organizational integration in a culturally diverse society -- How women influence organizations : strategies and approaches -- Using action training to empower women managers : lessons from an experimental workshop -- Tools, strategies, and approaches for trainers and HRD professionals -- One-on-one strategies : even small successes contribute to change"],"title":"The integration of women in management : a guide for human resources and management development specialists"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"integrativethera0000smit","subject":["Pastoral counseling","Psychotherapy -- Religious aspects -- Christianity","Pastoral psychology"],"description":["242 p. ; 23 cm","Includes bibliographical references (p. 217-229) and indexes"],"title":"Integrative therapy"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"integrityincolle0000proj","subject":["Bachelor of arts degree -- United States","Bachelor of liberal studies -- United States","Universities and colleges -- Curricula -- United States -- Evaluation","College teaching -- United States","Bachelor of arts degree","Bachelor of liberal studies","College teaching","Universities and colleges -- Curricula -- Evaluation","United States"],"description":["vi, 47 pages ; 23 cm","The decline and devaluation of the undergraduate degree -- Faculty responsibility: obstacles and incentives -- A minimum required curriculum -- Study in depth -- The problem of accountability -- The profession of college teaching"],"title":"Integrity in the college curriculum : a report to the academic community"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"integrityofbibli0000elli","subject":["Bible -- Hermeneutics","Preaching","Story sermons -- History and criticism","Storytelling -- Religious aspects -- Christianity","Narration in the Bible"],"description":["128 p. ; 22 cm","Includes bibliographical references (p. 102-122) and index"],"title":"The integrity of biblical narrative : story in theology and proclamation"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"intel-unix-sv-r4-v2","subject":["Intel","AT&T","Unix","System V","Unix System V","OS","Operating System","386","486","Pentium"],"description":"Intel Unix System V Revision 4.0 Version 2.0 (According to Labels) AT&T Unix System V\/386 Release 4.0 Version 2.0 (According to Software) This is an early enterprise release of the Unix operating system, ported from AT&T's System V by Intel to run on their 386 processors.

However, it became apparent that any one tutor was too limited, both for the purposes of the study and for those of students.

If you're wanting to help preserve this set, you can use the link below to download everything directly. That will make sure you get everything saved without trouble! Also, I highly recommend using a download manager such as the Link Grabber feature in JDownloader 2 to make sure you get the quickest and most reliable connections possible. Just copy this link and add it to the Grabber. That's it! It should autofill all the folders and files automatically for easy download: archive.org\/download\/intellivision-champion-collection-updated ------------- Want to learn more about how I put my collections together, discover my other vintage content, or\u00a0 join the Retro Game Champion community on Discord, Twitch, and your socials ?

If you're only after the actual games in this set, feel free to delete those titles named above. Items removed : Non-working dumps, duplicates, and\u00a0 prototypes of games that eventually saw a release. Release notes : This is a re-work of my previous Sega Saturn set, which I did a couple years back. It was a little messy and a few new dumps have been completed since then. I've hand-tested these new additions, added 3 more titles overall, upgraded some others to newer revisions, and organized the files much cleaner than last time.

Experiments were carried out in two water basins and in a long towing tank through the use of measurements, flow visualization, and an infrared camera. The results have shown that all types of vortex pairs over a wide range of Froude Numbers give rise to three-dimensional surface disturbances, known as scars and striations. The striations are a consequence of the short wavelength instability inherent to the vortex pair itself. The scars are transported outward by the vortex pair and are comprised of a constellation of coherent vortical structures (whirls). The experiments have provided sufficient understanding of the physics of the phenomenon and led to the development of a numerical model based on vortex dynamics. This model proved to be capable of explaining the physical processes involved in the evolution of the three-dimensional footprints of the vortex pair.","title":"Interaction of a vortex pair with a free surface : measurements and computations"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"interactionplaya0000jimm","subject":["Daily Living and Social Interaction","Multiple Disabilities"],"description":"\"Children with multiple disabilities may require assistance in order to interact and play with people and objects.\" -- introduction","title":"Interaction and Play: Adapt-A-Strategy Booklet Series for Parents and Teachers of Infants\/Young Children with Multiple Disabilities"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"interactions1wri00mseg","subject":["ELT: specific skills","Foreign Language Study","Language Arts \/ Linguistics \/ Literacy","English","Language","Linguistics","Language Arts & Disciplines","English as a Second Language","English language","English language Writing skills"],"description":["\"An EBI book.\"","CHAPTER ONE.

Personal computers have a great potential as tools for managing information. Effectiveness of using personal computers is determined by how easy it is to use them, since majority of the end-users are not computer experts. Compared with the advances in software design, the important issue of computer interface has begun to be addressed recently. There has been a research joining the database with the graphical interface to give users an easy-to-use method for accessing the database. With this, users navigate through the database by following the links from one piece of information to the next. There are several classes of softwares (languages) to build visual user interfaces: traditional, object-oriented, and interface-driven languages. This thesis, used an interface-driven software named Guide to build a prototype visual user interface to analyze the effectiveness of interface-driven software.","title":"Interface-driven software development tool"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"interfacemancoli00knox","subject":["Thane, Colin (Fictitious character) -- Fiction.","Police -- Scotland -- Fiction.","Glasgow (Scotland) -- Fiction."],"title":"The interface man"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"interfaceofmarke0000unse","subject":["Marketing -- Decision making","Marketing -- Management"],"description":["xxi, 453 p. : 24 cm","Includes bibliographical references"],"title":"The Interface of marketing and strategy"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"interfacialtrans0000slat","subject":["Transport theory","Surfaces (Physics)","Mass transfer","Heat -- Transmission","Entropy"],"description":["xvi, 1159 p. : 24 cm","Includes bibliographical references and indexes"],"title":"Interfacial transport phenomena"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"interfacinglabor00dere","subject":["Computer interfaces","Microcomputers","Automatic data collection systems","Interfaces","Meettechniek","Dataprocessing","Laboratoriumonderzoek","Messtechnik","Mikrocomputer","Schnittstelle","Microcomputer systems Interfaces with peripheral equipment"],"description":"Includes index","title":"Interfacing : a laboratory approach using the microcomputer for instrumentation, data analysis, and control"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"interfacingtoibm00egge_0","subject":["IBM Personal Computer.","Computer interfaces."],"title":"Interfacing to the IBM Personal Computer"},{"date":"1990-03-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"interferenze-da-propagazione-troposferica","subject":["libro","televisione","book","television"],"description":"\"Interferenze da propagazione troposferica \u2013 Disturbi sporadici estivi alla ricezione televisiva dovuti a stazioni TV isocanale lontane\", a cura del Supporto Tecnico Controllo Qualit\u00e0 Servizio della RAI","title":"Interferenze da propagazione troposferica"},{"date":"1990-06-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"interferometrics1094535036","subject":["Synthetic aperture radar","Oceanography","Interferometric SAR","Scene coherence time","2D wavenumber spectra","Surface Currents"],"description":"The potential of a method to remotely measure near-surface currents and dominant wave spectra using Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar INSAR is demonstrated. INSAR consists of a single conventional SAR augmented by an additional receiving antenna. The phase difference between corresponding SAR image scenes observed by the antennas provides an interferogram directly proportional to the ocean surface velocity field. This direct motion detection by INSAR suggests a significant advance compared with conventional SAR where the response to the moving ocean surface is indirectly related to complex modulation of the surface reflectivity by longer waves and currents. An experiment using an airborne INSAR to measure ocean surface currents and wave fields, compared with simultaneous ground truth measurements using Lagrangian drifters and wave array data was conducted in Monterey Bay. INSAR measured mean current magnitude estimates agree to within 10% compared with conventional measurements. The INSAR image wavenumber spectrum is consistent with the in situ directional spectrum and with predicted numerical refraction model outputs. Wavelength of the observed swells is better agreement (correlation better than 0.9) than wave direction. An attempt to estimate the scene coherence time for L-band SAR was made by taking advantage of the almost simultaneously acquired SAR and INSAR images. The obtained mean scene coherence time (100 msec) is consistent with sparse observed estimates in the literature.","title":"Interferometric SAR imaging of ocean surface currents and wavefields"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"interferometry891121inte","subject":["Interferometry -- Congresses","Interferometers -- Congresses"],"description":["xvi, 661 p. : 28 cm","Includes bibliographical references and index"],"title":"Interferometry '89 : 100 years after Michelson--state of the art and applications : proceedings : 8-12 May 1989, Warsaw, Poland"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"interferometryof0000bara","subject":["Fibers -- Optical properties","Interferometry"],"description":["xv, 161 p., 3 p. of plates : 24 cm","Includes bibliographical references"],"title":"Interferometry of fibrous materials"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"interieurjandesb0000bouv","subject":["Bouvrie, Jan des -- Themes, motives","Interior decoration -- Netherlands -- History -- 20th century -- Themes, motives"],"description":"132 p. : 26 cm","title":"Interieur, Jan des Bouvrie"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"interimdesignrev00ontauoft","title":"Interim Design and Review Guidelines for Wood Fired Combustors - Approvals Branch"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"interimindeserts0000sodo","subject":["FICTION -- General","Short stories, American","English","American Literature","Languages & Literatures"],"description":["1 online resource (269 pages)","A collection of short stories that deal with the difficulties of adolescence, and portrays adults still groping for those identities the young believe they have already","Print version record","Electronic reproduction.

Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and Internet Protocol (IP) are the two standard communication protocols from which TCP\/IP receives its name. By utilizing TCP\/IP, the majority of technical issues of interconnecting various computer technologies have become transparent to the user. This thesis conducts an in depth study of many aspects of the TCP\/IP technology. Based upon descriptions provided, flowcharts detailing the series of procedures of numerous functions of both TCP and IP are created. Additionally, inefficient TCP\/IP functions are discussed and possible solutions to the inefficiencies are provided.","title":"Internetworking with Internet Protocol (IP) and Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) within the Military"},{"date":"1990-09-25T00:00:00Z","identifier":"internshape-logo","subject":["Internship Programs","Internship Certificate","Internship in Noida"],"description":"Internshape offers internship programs in Noida by highly experienced professionals and provide Internship certificate from various top level industries.

Interpretation and Instruction Path Coprocessing presents an analysis of interpretive systems, and cost-effective software and hardware optimizations of the interpretive process on CISC and RISC architectures. It groups and presents concepts that are seldom found together and elaborates on ideas that are not part of the mainstream of recent hardware developments. The authors explore the techniques used in interpretive systems on general purpose microprocessor architectures. A key contribution is their investigation of how, and to what extent, interpretive execution can be accelerated using dedicated coprocessors. They analyze the advantages and drawbacks of interpretations, present both software and hardware techniques to improve interpretation and introduce the concept of coprocessing in the instruction path as a cost-effective way of boosting the execution speed of interpreters running on microprocessors. The RISC versus CISC issue is analyzed from the viewpoint of interpretations and its hardware support.","ix, 192 pages : 24 cm","Includes bibliographical references ([175]-186)"],"title":"Interpretation and instruction path coprocessing"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"interpretationof0000jone","subject":["Arrhythmia -- Diagnosis","Electrocardiography","Arrhythmia -- diagnosis"],"description":["iv, 293 p. : 24 cm","Includes bibliographical references (p. 293)"],"title":"Interpretation of the electrocardiogram : a review for health professionals"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"interpretationof0000unse_f6l3","subject":["Accounting -- Problems, exercises, etc","Accounting","Business Accounts"],"description":"viii, 267 pages","title":"Interpretation of accounts"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"interpretationof0000unse_l2v9","subject":["Communication","Dialogue"],"description":["vii, 376 p. ; 24 cm","Includes index","Includes bibliographical references and index"],"title":"The Interpretation of dialogue"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"interpretationof0002edcart_f8k8","subject":["Breast -- Cancer -- Diagnosis","Breast -- Biopsy","Breast Diseases -- diagnosis","Breast Diseases -- pathology","Breast Neoplasms -- diagnosis","Breast Neoplasms -- pathology","Maladies du sein -- Diagnostic","Maladies du sein -- Anatomopathologie","Tumeurs du sein -- Diagnostic","Tumeurs du sein -- Anatomopathologie","Biopsie","Mamma","NEOPLASIAS MAMA\u0301RIAS","MAMA","Sein -- Maladies -- Diagnostic","Sein -- Cancer"],"description":["x, 246 pages : 25 cm","Includes bibliographical references"],"title":"Interpretation of breast biopsies"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"interpretationof00skin","subject":["Biochemical oxygen demand","Sewage","Water"],"description":["Includes bibliographical references","2 15 48"],"title":"Interpretation of ultimate biochemical oxygen demand data via kinetic curve extrapolation models"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"interpretingcomp0000holm_a2p0","subject":["Financial statements","Corporation reports","Companies Published Accounts Interpretation"],"description":"x, 219 pages : 30 cm","title":"Interpreting company reports and accounts"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"interpretingcons0000unse","subject":["Constitutional law -- United States","Constitutional history -- United States"],"description":["x, 357 p. : 24 cm","Includes bibliographical references (p. 337-340) and indexes"],"title":"Interpreting the Constitution : the debate over original intent"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"interpretingcons0000well","subject":["Judicial review -- United States","Constitutional law -- United States","Judicial process -- United States"],"description":["xii, 196 p. ; 22 cm","Includes bibliographical references (p. 181-189) and index"],"title":"Interpreting the Constitution : the Supreme Court and the process of adjudication"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"interpretingcons00harr","subject":["Constitution: government & the state","Constitutional & administrative law","USA","Constitutional","Legal System","Law \/ General","Politics \/ Current Events","Reference","Judicial review","Constitutional law","Judicial process","Recurso contencioso administrativo","Contro\u0302le juridictionnel des lois","Processus judiciaire","Droit constitutionnel","Grondwetten","Rechtsinterpretatie","Supreme Court (VS)","Constitution","United States"],"description":["Includes bibliographical references (pages 181-189) and index","Discusses judicial review and the interpretive role the Court plays in constitutional regulation and the resolution of individual dispute"],"title":"Interpreting the Constitution : the Supreme Court and the process of adjudication"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"interpretingcons00harr_0","subject":["Constitution: government & the state","Constitutional & administrative law","USA","Constitutional","Legal System","Law \/ General","Politics \/ Current Events","Reference","Judicial review","Constitutional law","Judicial process","Recurso contencioso administrativo","Contro\u0302le juridictionnel des lois","Processus judiciaire","Droit constitutionnel","Grondwetten","Rechtsinterpretatie","Supreme Court (VS)","Constitution","United States"],"description":["Includes bibliographical references (pages 181-189) and index","Discusses judicial review and the interpretive role the Court plays in constitutional regulation and the resolution of individual dispute"],"title":"Interpreting the Constitution : the Supreme Court and the process of adjudication"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"interpretingcult0000unse","subject":["Anne (Mother of the Virgin Mary), Saint -- Cult","Anne (Mother of the Virgin Mary), Saint","Anna Heilige, Biblische Person ca. 1.

Incorporation of a power MOSFET as a switching element alleviates switching loss. However, values of R sub DS(on) (drain-to-source resistance in the on-state) for MOSFET's are of such magnitude to produce greater on-state losses than an equivalent BJT operated in saturation. This research serves to introduce a design concept, pertinent to low-voltage relatively-high-current applications, that minimizes the peak current through the switching element in order to reduce average power loss. Basic waveforms produced by different PWM and resonant mode topologies were examined. Theoretical analysis reveals that a ramp-sine current waveform could cut conduction power loss by at least 18% over a conventional Buck switching converter. A 14V, 14W combination quasi-resonant Buck\/ZCS, Quasi-Resonant Buck dc-dc converter with an unregulated input voltage of 28 V was built for simplicity to demonstrate one particular waveshaping technique. This converter represents a useful example of an actual circuit which is capable of producing the desired ramp-sine switch-current waveform. Final results confirm improvement in conduction loss enhancing existing power MOSFET technology for use in dc-dc power conversion.","title":"Introduction of a current waveform, waveshaping technique to limit conduction loss in high-frequency dc-dc converters suitable for space power"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"introductionofel0000piot","subject":["Mathematical linguistics","Linguistique informatique","Traitement automatique des langues naturelles","Mathematische Linguistik","Linguistics Applications of mathematics"],"description":["xiv, 260 pages : 22 cm","Includes bibliographical references (pages 253-260)"],"title":"Introduction of elements of mathematics to linguistics"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"introductionofge0000unse","subject":["Genetic engineering -- Safety measures","Genetic engineering -- Environmental aspects"],"description":["xi, 201 p. ; 24 cm","Includes bibliographical references"],"title":"Introduction of genetically modified organisms into the environment"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"introductiontoab00luca","subject":"Mathematics","description":"Includes index","title":"Introduction to abstract mathematics"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"introductiontoac0000dann_r5q4","subject":["Vocabulary","English language -- Roots","English language -- Etymology","English language -- Foreign elements","English language -- Technical English","Learning and scholarship -- Terminology","German language -- Influence on English","Latin language -- Influence on English","Greek language -- Influence on English"],"description":["xxi, 311 p. ; 28 cm","Includes bibliographical references (p. 249-252) and index"],"title":"An introduction to an academic vocabulary : word clusters from Latin, Greek, and German : a vade mecum for the serious student"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"introductiontoac0000lang_o8i6","subject":["Accounting","Einfu\u0308hrung","Rechnungswesen"],"description":"x, 375 pages","title":"Introduction to accounting for business studies"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"introductiontoad0000barn","subject":"Mathematics","description":"xv, 320 pages","title":"Introduction to advanced mechanics"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"introductiontoad0000belc","subject":["Advertising","Sales promotion","Communication in marketing","Publicite\u0301","Ventes -- Promotion","Communication en marketing"],"description":["xxix, 770 pages : 29 cm","Includes bibliographical references and index"],"title":"Introduction to advertising and promotion management"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"introductiontoam00mari","subject":"Amphibious warfare","description":["\"MCI 7640\" -- Title page","\"Marine Corps Institute, Marine Barracks, Washington, D.C.\" -- Cover","\"Amphibious Warfare School Nonresident Program\" -- Cover","Student information -- Program -- Program outline -- Abbreviations and acronyms -- Table of contents -- Introduction to amphibious operations -- Introduction to naval operations -- Amphibious staff functioning -- Intelligence in amphibious operations -- NBC considerations in amphibious operations -- Soviet defense of a coastline -- Course evaluation questionnaire","\"Before World War II, the importance and affect of amphibious operations on the security of the nation was not yet realized.

The first part of the thesis describes selected principles and concepts of C3 related to communication management, interoperability, command structure and standardization. The Crisis Action System is described emphasizing the roles and functions of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Office of the Secretary of Defense. A discussion of decision making in command and control examines the principles of unity of command, echelon skipping and span of control. Finally, the Joint Task Force (JTF) apparatus is reviewed from the perspective of interoperability. The second part of the thesis contains four case studies designed to provide an understanding of command and control by developing a competence to diagnose and solve command and control situations. The solutions to the cases require applying the principles and concepts presented in the first part. The four cases are: (1) the Iran hostage rescue attempt; (2) the invasion of Grenada; (3) the raid on Libya; and (4) the rescue of the S.S.

Bach piece has stricter rules compared to romantic pieces. First of all, you must keep the time. When you play this hands together, you have to play the eighth notes carefully. Just like paragraphs, or designs, patterns, these are all the same patterns, you need to play them carefully. Bach likes the pieces that start with silence, the first beat being silence. It\u2019s the beginning of the phrase so therefore, it starts quietly. That is the most important note in that phrase. You shouldn\u2019t be skipping. That\u2019s the way it should be played. That\u2019s how they are connected. Dr. Haruko Kataoka:\u00a0 Always the important note, you must play down. Kagari Tanabe:\u00a0 If you do it roughly, you are going to break your hand. You can\u2019t lose that center. You can\u2019t do a good job. We are not only talking about piano playing, but with anything else. Dr. Haruko Kataoka: Ready, down, take down. Don\u2019t lose your body balance. Don\u2019t dance. Watch me. Kagari Tanabe: There are only those two ways to play the piano. Dr. Haruko Kataoka:\u00a0 Down\u2026not up\u2026down\u2026.I mean down\u2026.don\u2019t hold your finger up. If you move the elbow, you lose concentration. Down\u2026that\u2019s right\u2026.very good\u2026again. Kagari Tanabe:\u00a0 Because we don\u2019t have much time, those beats are pillars. You should play them like that in Bach pieces. If you do this kind of practice every day for one week, you can play this much better. Dr. Haruko Kataoka:\u00a0 I think you are a very good student. You are very smart and your fingers move. Kagari Tanabe:\u00a0 But, you can\u2019t play important notes correctly, therefore you couldn\u2019t keep the tempo. But, just by using the metronome you can fix that problem. Is it displayed all week. Is she using it? You need to do always. The rest is fine. This is very important.\u00a0 It is very hard to build a house if you don\u2019t have the important pillars. It\u2019s a big problem. ---------- 5-07.

If I make an example for you to see, it is like a house that is drawn on a piece of paper. You must make a real house, not a drawn house. It has to be a real house for anyone to enter in. Right?\u00a0 The first beat is the most important thing, the rest isn\u2019t. That\u2019s accented. Take up. Play it inside. Try it, please. That would be a push\u2026.take.\u00a0 Always like this. The best pianists use the 1st joint. If you don\u2019t, then the fingers become very weak. Human beings have very strong fingertips. Would you pull this. I was holding this cloth with only my fingertips. But that is how strong our fingertips are. When she tried to play, her fingertip went the other way. When you see something like that, you think they are double jointed but that\u2019s not right at all. If you let students carry or hold a very big glass of milk, this won\u2019t happen (a bent 1st joint) the joint always works just perfect. That\u2019s how God made our fingers naturally. You must make it like that each and every lesson through all books every time. And you forgot to hold your thumb\u2026it must be tucked under always when it\u2019s not used. You are a very good student. If you play the 1st and the 3rd beat correctly (couldn\u2019t hear). Can you do both hands just like that. No, that is a drawn house. It should not be flat, but it should be dimensional. As soon as she starts playing with both hands, it\u2019s not working well. So, this means, you need to practice one hand at a time. Do you have your music?\u00a0 So you have a pencil? This kind of thing should be also taught. Without particular articulation, you can do any way you want.\u00a0 This is the same as if you talk about clothes. It\u2019s the same pattern. You must teach each one exactly for the students to understand what is going on. People who didn\u2019t understand children's education, they kept saying you didn\u2019t use the text here. Therefore, you can\u2019t understand anything from the score at all. Yes, your text is very good. Those that are professionals\u2026they like good texts. But, for beginners, the texts that are edited are helpful. You need to do practices like that. That is the wrong way. Those four designs are connected. These are reversed, opposite side. You need to know how to practice. Teachers must teach these things to students so they will know what is going on and won\u2019t get into trouble. If you keep practicing like that, then you can add many additions, and you will have a beautiful house. You are a very good student. And your mom must be a nice mother. And the teacher is lucky to have a student like you. Editor\u2019s note: minor editing has been done to facilitate readability. Notes in parenthesis are for clarification. ---------- 5-07.

This thesis is designed to answer two questions. Is there a significant difference between the NISTARS non-mechanized warehouses and the other types of warehouses? What are the reasons for the difference if one exists? The data were extracted from the official inventory reports of the Naval Supply Center, San Diego, CA. To ensure the data were representative of the inventory position of all warehouses under the control of the supply center, they were taken from the NAVSUP required quarterly STATMAN random sampled inventories. The study indicates that there is a significant difference (13% less) in the inventory accuracy in non-mechanized warehouses under NISTARS control. Also, that the research codes used in the inventory reports are not effective.

The discrepancies are worst at higher drive ratios (the ratio of the peak acoustic pressure amplitude at a pressure antinode to the mean pressure of the gas), where prominent irregularities in the data series appear. In the previous work, the measurements were made with thermopiles having junctions that were located along the leading and trailing edges of the TAC plates. Because of its proximity to the edge, the thermopile may have been sensitive to effects which, though perhaps causing local deviations in the temperature profile, do not affect the temperature profile in interior regions of the plate. To investigate whether edge effects are the cause of any of these discrepancies, we have constructed a TAC with two thermopile, whose conjunction do not lie along the edge, and repeated some of the previous measurements. Measurements were also made with a stack of long plates to probe how far the irregularities extend in to the interior of the plate. It was found that the irregularities are not isolated to the edge of the TAC. The temperature profile of interior portions of the plates mimic that measured along the edge.","title":"Investigation of edge effects in thermoacoustic couple measurements"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"investigationofh135mehn","subject":["Hydrogeology","Groundwater","Geophysical well logging"],"description":["Errata slip inserted","\"HWRIC RR 051.\"","Includes bibliographical references"],"title":"Investigation of the hydraulic effects of deep-well injection of industrial wastes : final report"},{"date":"1990-09-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"investigationofi1094534948","subject":["Computer Assisted Search","Antisubmarine Warfare","Tactical Decision Aids"],"description":"The goal of this thesis is to investigate the initial search planning phase of the Search and Localization Tactical Decision Aid (SALT) developed by METRON, Incorporated of McLean, VA. SALT is a Computer Assisted Search (CAS) program intended for use by P3 UPDATE IV crews to assist them in optimal deployment of a sonobuoy field to prosecute a submarine threat. The initial search planning phase of SALT takes as user inputs environmental data, an initial elliptical Search Probability Area, an assumed target motion model, and the duration of the search. Outputs include a recommended sonobuoy pattern and the probability of detection of this pattern. The investigation of this phase of the algorithm is conducted in two parts. First, a series of simulation routines is used to ensure that the probability of detection of the sonobuoy patterns generated by SALT is mathematically correct. Second, these same computerized simulation routines are used to determine if there are alternate sonobuoy patterns that result in higher probabilities of detection.","title":"Investigation of initial detection models in the Search and Localization Tactical Decision Aid (SALT)"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"investigationofp00berr","description":["Thesis (M.S. in Civil Eng.)

We have investigated the mechanism of activation in SV40-transformed cells and we find that the effect is due to an increase in the activity of the general class III transcription factor TFIIIC, achieved both by an increase in factor abundance and by a change in its phosphorylation state. SV40 transformation also stimulates transcription of other genes by RNA polymerase III but the effect may be balanced by compensatory post-transcriptional changes.

Mayer argues that though Hitler was always viciously anti-Semitic, the genocide was not part of his plan from the start. Instead, it was triggered when the Nazi's massive campaign against Russia began to founder. Mayer places what Hitler called \"the Final Solution\" in historical context, examining both the prewar political situation in Europe that made it possible, and some analogous, if much less horrific, events in the distant past.

Sparks fly even within his own family when his mother's adopted son, Jeremy, is imprisoned because of a false accusation.

It is hoped that knowledge of Japan will leave the student better prepared to face an increasingly interdependent world.

He can be held up as a \"terrible example\" of conduct, a model of what not to do, and yet admired for a careless. anarchistic energy that suggests unlimited possibilities. Mourning Dove, an Okanagan, knew him well from the legends handed down by her people. She preserved them for posterity in Coyote Stories, originally published in 1933. Here is Coyote, the trickster, the selfish individualist, the imitator, the protean character who indifferently puts the finishing touches on a world soon to receive human beings. And here is Mole, his long-suffering wife, and all the other Animal People, including Fox, Chipmunk, Owl-Woman, Rattlesnake, Grizzly Bear, Porcupine, and Chickadee.

Now translated in its entirety for the first time, Theory of Prose not only anticipates structuralism and post-structuralism, but poses questions about the nature of fiction that are as provocative today as they were in the 1920s. Arguing that writers structure their material according to artistic principles rather than from attempts to imitate \"reality,\" Shklovsky uses Cervantes, Tolstoi, Sterne, Dickens, Bely, and Rozanov to give us a new way of thinking about fiction and, in his most impassioned moments, about the world.

As John Rose brought his wife Gerrie home from a Green Bay hospital, he was concerned they would walk into a messy house. He needn't have worried. While the couple was away, someone entered their Washington Island home, not to ransack it, but to clean it and get it ready for the returning couple. Residents say this kind of caring is typical on this 20-square-mile island off the point of the Door County Penninsula. Some say it keeps the community of 646 year-round residents here. Established in 1850 as Door County's first town, Washington Island has evolved in the last 140 years from a lumber and fishing town to a summer tourist magnet. Town officials estimate that nearly 400,000 tourists visit the island each year. Sylvia Nelson, an island native and schoolteacher here for 50 years, has carefully watched her community change. One of many Icelandic descendants here, she remembers the commercial fishing boon, the rise and fall of dairy and potato farming, the advent of the automobile and the tourism it helped draw. \"Fishing was a very, very great part of our economy,\" Nelson said.","title":"Island Is Home To Close Knit Community"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"island00paul","subject":["Identity","Nature","Islands","Identity (Philosophical concept)"],"description":["\"Laurel-leaf books.\"","\"Reprinted by arrangement with Franklin Watts, Inc., on behalf of Orchard Books\"--T.p. verso","Fifteen-year-old Wil discovers himself and the wonders of nature when he leaves home to live on an island in northern Wisconsin"],"title":"The island"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"islanddeception00duke","title":"Island deception"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"islandenchantres0000myru","description":"352 p. ; 18 cm","title":"Island enchantress"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"islandencounters0000lind","subject":["World War, 1939-1945 -- Campaigns -- Pacific Area -- Pictorial works -- Exhibitions","World War, 1939-1945 -- Campaigns -- Pacific Area -- Exhibitions"],"description":["viii, 194 p. : 29 cm","Based, in part, on a photographic exhibition which opened March 30, 1987 at the East-West Center, Honolulu, Hawaii","Includes bibliographical references (p. 185-190) and index"],"title":"Island encounters : black and white memories of the Pacific War"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"islanderstormlan00john_0","subject":["Fantasy - General","Fiction - Fantasy","Fantastic fiction","Science Fiction","Science fiction"],"title":"The islander"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"islandnewperspec0000unse","subject":"Cape Breton Island (N.S.) -- History","description":["ix, 325 p. : 24 cm","Includes bibliographical references"],"title":"The Island : new perspectives on Cape Breton's history, 1713-1990"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"islandnights00sand","title":"Island nights"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"islandofbluedolp0000odel_v4t9","subject":["Indians of North America -- Juvenile fiction","Chumash women -- Juvenile fiction","Survival -- Juvenile fiction","Islands -- Juvenile fiction","Dolphins -- Juvenile fiction","Human-animal relationships -- Juvenile fiction","Indians of North America -- Fiction","Survival -- Fiction","Islands -- Fiction","Chumash women","Dolphins","Human-animal relationships","Indians of North America","Islands","Survival","Survival skills -- Fiction","Newbery Medal books","San Nicolas Island (Calif.) -- Juvenile fiction","California -- San Nicolas Island"],"description":["181 pages, 12 unnumbered leaves of plates : 24 cm","In the Pacific there is an island that looks like a big fish sunning itself in the sea.

better advantage of object-oriented database technology, domain analysis and rule based systems. A method for using the Prototyping System Description Language (PSDL) augmented with domain dependent keywords to classify reusable Ada components and organize them in an object-oriented database is presented. A rule based structure needed to implement this software base is also described. Implementation of this structure is a goal for further research.","title":"Issues in expanding the Software Base Management System Supporting the Computer Aided Prototyping System"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"issuesinfeminist00eren","subject":["Women in motion pictures","Feminism and motion pictures","Feminist film criticism"],"description":"Includes bibliographical references (p. 425-438) and index","title":"Issues in feminist film criticism"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"issuesinjusticee0000unse","subject":"Criminal justice, Administration of -- United States","description":["175 p. : 22 cm","Includes bibliographical references"],"title":"Issues in justice : exploring policy issues in the criminal justice system"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"issuesinl2theory0000dela","subject":["Language and languages -- Study and teaching -- Congresses","Second language acquisition -- Congresses"],"description":["vii, 288 p. : 24 cm","\"Proceedings of the 7th Delaware Symposium on Language Studies, October 1985, the University of Delaware.\"","Includes bibliographical references and indexes"],"title":"Issues in L2 : theory as practice, practice as theory"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"issuesinphilosop0000pinc","subject":["Philosophy","Philosophy -- Introductions","Philosophie"],"description":["ix, 366 pages ; 23 cm","Includes bibliographical references (pages 357-359) and index"],"title":"Issues in philosophy"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"issuesinsocialis00fisc","description":["\"November 1990.\"","Includes bibliographical references"],"title":"Issues in socialist economy reform"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"issuesinwetlands0000unse","subject":["Wetland conservation -- United States","Wetland management -- United States"],"description":["xix, 230 p. ; 28 cm","Includes bibliographical references"],"title":"Issues in wetlands protection : background papers prepared for the National Wetlands Policy Forum"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"issuesofbloodpol0000laws","subject":["Menstruation -- Social aspects","Menstruation -- Public opinion","Feminism"],"description":["xiii, 244 p. : 23 cm","Includes bibliographical references (p. 222-236) and index"],"title":"Issues of blood : the politics of menstruation"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"issuesofheartmem0000olse","subject":["Olsen, Howard, 1947-","United States.

Like others in the town of Taurianova, he and his schoolteacher wife contend with Mafia rule and the ineffectiveness of the government in dealing with it. There are no magic bullets for Guiseppe's S & L, just real ones. Enemy Mine, a six-part series, gives voice to ordinary individuals whose lives bear witness to the contemporary consequences of age-old tensions. These narratives may seem like fictional constructs, but they are true, and they are enacted by the real people involved, not by actors.","title":"Italy South Of Italy"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"italy0000hobl","subject":["Automobile travel -- Italy -- Guidebooks","Wines and wine-making -- Italy","Italy -- Description and travel -- Guidebooks","Italy Wine-growing regions"],"description":["144p. : 25cm","Bibliography: p140. - Includes index"],"title":"Italy"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"italybeautifulco0000deme","subject":"Cooking, Italian","description":["\"1991 engagement calendar.\"","\"Authentic recipes from the regions of Italy.\"","Includes index"],"title":"Italy, the beautiful cookbook"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"italyincludingsi0000unse","subject":"Hotels, taverns, etc. -- Italy -- Guidebooks","description":["206 pages : 21 cm","Includes indexes"],"title":"Italy, including Sicily and Sardinia"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"italyshorthistor00hear","subject":"Italy -- History.","description":"Includes bibliographical references and index","title":"Italy : a short history"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"italyworldcup1990000unse","subject":"World Cup (Football championship) (1990 : Italy)","description":["160p. :","Spine title: World Cup 1990"],"title":"Italy World Cup 1990"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"itbeganwithroarb0000wege","subject":["San Diego Zoo -- History","San Diego Zoo"],"description":["181 pages : 25 cm","\"First published in 1953\"--Title page verso","Includes index"],"title":"It began with a roar! : the beginning of the world-famous San Diego Zoo"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"itc-reports_itc-11360","description":"ITC 1.13:60 Digitized from IA1177303-25-0074 , IA1177303-25-0073 .","title":"Trade Between the United States and the Nonmarket Economy Countries During July-September 1989, 60th Quarterly Report to the Congress & The Trade Policy Committee...

We apply two new techniques, namely diagonal perturbation and multiple partitioning, to existing finite impulse response (FIR) and infinite impulse response (IIR) fixed data matrix splitting algorithms, resulting in improved performance. Also, we extend the fixed data algorithms to the data-adaptive case, and contrast them with FIR and IIR recursive least squares (RLS) algorithms. Computer simulations are used to evaluate the computational effectiveness of the new algorithms. We show the general rate of convergence for the algorithms, evaluate their ability to correctly represent the spectral components of simulated system frequency response in noise, and present system performance, when the order of the model is chosen to be larger than the known system order (over-modeling).","title":"Iterative methods for parameter estimation"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"ithadtobeyou0000doug","title":"It had to be you"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"ithappenedinchel0000free","subject":"Humorous stories","description":["The inhabitants of the mythical mid-European town of Chelm consult their Town Council of seven wise men when their shops are robbed by bandits in the night","[62] pages : 23 cm"],"title":"It happened in Chelm : a story of the legendary town of fools"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"ithappenedonenig0000ferr","description":"219 pages ; 17 cm","title":"It happened one night"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"ithappenstoevery00myer","subject":["Schools","Teachers"],"description":"Both Michael and a new teacher nervously prepare for the first day of school","title":"It happens to everyone"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"ithinkthereforei0000paul_b9j9","subject":["Logic","Philosophy -- Humor"],"description":["viii, 163 p. : 21 cm","Reprint.

These players were all from Boulder CO in 1990, when this was made, only Barry is still there. At the time there was huge excitement for free improv among Boulder musicians, regular wed. night sessions at Peter's photo lab, big space in the rear. I organized some all-are-welcome gatherings of musicians, dancers, visual artists, actors, at a warehouse space, Boulder Art Gallery. Barry was (as I remember) uncertain of his ability on the trumpet, but so much more full of stimulating musical ideas to make up for it. I'm here on track 3 with some typical overplaying on my WWI version Buescher curved soprano, which I bought for $50 because the pawnbroker (from whom I bought all my horns) thought it was a toy. Peter, now living in NM, was the most appropriate drummer, also non-pro and just loving music. (Later I played with Gordon Kennedy--I'll be releasing some of our trio with Terry Sines later--and the late Bob Mulligan). At the time this was just called free improv, today it would be sorted as free jazz, which in my opinion rarely reaches these heights of imaginative freedom and spontaneous connectedness. Track Four--Different session-- lots of stuff thrown in here, me playing again like an excited soloist on speed (not true) but a e-bass and guitar were there to make that a bit less obvious, maybe Joe Pezillo?. From an almost-tight freejazz trio in track one to this, yet there's real communication going on. Lots of funny melodic bits thrown in; we're obviously having a good time. This is what those stuffy folks at Naropa thought was definitely NOT SPIRITUAL This comment from Barry after hearing this the first time in fifteen years: \"When I listen to these recordings, I remember the ridiculous confluence of deep listening and a sense of searching. I would try to pretend I'm someone else, maybe the psychotic entity lodged in my ankles and toes. It felt so freakin dangerous. I think it really scared me.\".","title":"Boulder Trio 1990"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"jack-radics-sexy-thing","subject":"#reggae #dancehall #raggamuffin #roots #urban","description":"Jack Radics -\u00a0Sexy Thing","title":"Sexy Thing"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"jack00home","subject":["Fathers and sons","Gay fathers","Homosexuality","Children of gay parents","Children of divorced parents","Fathers","Homophobia","Self-acceptance in teenage boys","Fifteen-year-old boys"],"description":["Fifteen-year-old Jack's confused feelings for his father, who left him and his mother four years earlier, are further complicated when he finds that his father is gay","Lexile: 810"],"title":"Jack"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"jack0home","subject":["Fathers and sons","Gay fathers","Homosexuality","Children of gay parents","Children of divorced parents","Fathers","Homophobia","Self-acceptance in teenage boys","Fifteen-year-old boys"],"description":["Fifteen-year-old Jack's confused feelings for his father, who left him and his mother four years earlier, are further complicated when he finds that his father is gay","Lexile: 810"],"title":"Jack"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"jackalice0000shel","subject":"Children's stories in English American writers 1945- Texts","description":"[27]p","title":"Jack and Alice"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"jackaroo-p-1-1990","subject":"australian tv miniseries jackaroo nineties drama romance","description":"JACKAROO (Part 1) (1990) Director: Michael Carson.

IT STARTS RIGHT HERE\u2026 JANE GOODALL: MY LIFE WITH THE CHIMPANZEES In the summer of 1960, 26-year-old Jane Goodall set out for Africa. Her mission was to find and observe an elusive tribe of chimpanzees. Today, almost three decades later, Jane has grown from a stranger to the chimp\u2019s loyal friend and strongest ally. Her lifelong dedication to the study of chimpanzees has helped to identify them as man\u2019s closest relative. In JANE GOODALL: MY LIFE WITH THE CHIMPANZEES, this extraordinary woman shares her personal story of the triumphs and trials that come with leading a life in the wild.

Japan, once defeated and occupied by the United States, now assails U.S. global economic and technological leadership. This thesis examines the effect Japanese technology has upon U.S. national security. Japanese technology has become a critical element of many U.S. defense weapons systems. A supply disruption could harm military readiness. Moreover, a decline in U.S. technological innovation, production, and sales, could severely harm U.S. global commitments and foreign policy. This rivalry is placing strains upon U.S.- Japanese relations. Debate has arisen in the United States about how these perceived problems should be handled. Some advocate letting the free market solve the problem while others propose managed trade solutions. The United States also needs to reevaluate its entire policy with Japan and the Asia- Pacific region, in light of a changing world environment and increasing U.S. financial difficulties.","title":"Japanese technology and U.S. national security"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"japanesewesterns0000wata","subject":["Geschichte","Wissenschaft","Ciencia -- Filosofi\u0301a -- Historia","Naturwissenschaften","Science -- history","Evolucio\u0301n -- Historia","Japan","Evolution Philosophy History","Westliche Welt","Science Japan History","Science -- Philosophy -- History","Science -- Japan -- History","Sciences -- Japon -- Histoire","Evolution -- Philosophy -- History","E\u0301volution -- Histoire -- Philosophie","Sciences -- Histoire -- Philosophie","Science","Evolution -- Philosophy","Wetenschap","Science -- Philosophy","Science Philosophy History","Evolution -- Histoire -- Philosophie","Ciencia -- Filosofia -- Historia","Evolucion -- Historia"],"description":["xiv, 141 pages : 24 cm","Translation of: Nihonjin to kindai kagaku","Includes bibliographical references (pages 133-135) and index","From Samurai to scientist : Yamagawa Kenjiro\u0304 -- Japan studies of foreign teachers in Japan : investigations of the magic mirror -- Theory of varying coefficients of reflections \/ Robert William Atkinson -- Theory of varying curvature due to the Megebo\u0304 \/ William Edward Ayrton, John Perry -- Theory of variation in curvature due to thermal stress \/ Gustave E.

The study of Japan is worthwhile because Japan currently is and likely will continue to be one of the world's most important countries.

It is hoped that knowledge of Japan will leave the student better prepared to face an increasingly interdependent world.

Het ambitieuze F3000-team Onyx van Mike Earl en Greg Field wil rond dezelfde periode eveneens een entreeticket voor de grid van de F1 en via een tussenpoortje vinden beide partijen elkaar. Onyx-Moneytron wordt geboren en maakt zich op voor de seizoensdeelname van 1989, in het era waarin Senna en Prost continu over elkaar heen rollen. Uiteraard ziet Van Rossem het groots. Hij neemt Marlboro mee aan boord, belooft podiumplaatsen en zet Earl aan het werk voor de bouw van niet alleen een fabriek, maar ook een windtunnel en een carbonatelier. Voor de piloten doet het team een beroep op de Zweed Stefan Johansson, de Belg Bertrand Gachot en als reserverijder de Fin J.J. Lehto. De start verloopt moeizaam. Tijdens de eerste grand prix raken de Onyx ORE-1-bolides, aangedreven door V8-motoren van Ford-Cosworth, moeilijk gekwalificeerd en vooral Gachot bakt er eigenlijk niks van en rijdt meer naast dan op de baan. Met als dieptepunt de GP van Spanje, waar het zelfs in de opwarmingsronde al van dattum is. Van Rossem daarover: \"Had ik het geweten, ik had het logo van Moneytron en de slogan \"Vive la R\u00e9publique\" op de bodemplaat van de wagen geplakt. Gachot hing meer met zijn wielen in de lucht dan hij op de baan bleef.\" Het zou tot een dispuut komen en escaleren waarna Lehto moest invallen voor de laatste koersen van het seizoen. Aan exuberantie ontbrak het dan weer niet. Steevast troonde Van Rossem acht supermodellen mee naar elke wedstrijd, telkens in bonte outfits paraderend. Het effect bleef zeker niet uit. Snelle wagens, sexy meisjes en een snuif Monaco-glamour, de cocktail lokte veel klanten naar het kantoor van Belgi\u00ebs bekendste econoom. En ondanks de slechte beurt van Gachot werden er op de piste toch successen geboekt. Johansson scoorde twee punten in de Grote Prijs van Frankrijk door vijfde te worden en in Portugal haalde hij zelfs brons, met een bolide waarvan de banden tot op de draad versleten waren. De Zweed had immers verzuimd pitstops te maken. Risico\u2019s nemen, de filosofie was ook tot bij de piloten geraakt. Knap was het sowieso, want niet veel teams zijn er al in geslaagd tijdens hun startseizoen een podiumplek te bemachtigen. Uiteindelijk zou het team tiende eindigen. Respectabel. Onyx-Moneytron zou echter ook de sportieve einde van Van Rossem inluiden. Porsche blies een motorendeal met Van Rossem af. Vervolgens kwam hij in opspraak als zou hij Bernie Ecclestone een maffiabaas en FIA-voorzitter Jean-Marie Balestre een ex-nazi hebben genoemd. Voor dat laatste had hij trouwens bewijzen ontvangen van een nieuwe ge\u00efnteresseerde sponsor. Van Rossem had ermee gedreigd op te stappen als de deal met Porsche knapte en deed dat ook.","title":"Jean Pierre Van Rossem verlaat de Formule 1"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"jean-pierre-van-rossem-wie-ben-ik-oudejaarsspecial-vtm-31-dec-1990","subject":["jean pierre van rossem","'wie ben ik ' oudejaarsspecial vtm 31 dec 1990","wie ben ik","jean","pierre","rossem","ben","ik","oudejaarsspecial","vtm","wie","urbanus","van rossem","quiz","thesis","spelletje","spel","urbain","televisie","tv","humor","gerard joling","liekens","goedele","werther","comedy","commercieel","jean-pierre","nostalgie","vlaams","studio","spelshow","jean-pierre van rossem"],"description":"Wie ben ik? is een komisch spelprogramma waarbij twee teams bestaande uit elk drie kandidaten moeten raden wie, wat of waar ze zijn.

The film was directed by William Hanna and Joseph Barbera from a screenplay by Dennis Marks, and stars the voices of George O'Hanlon, Penny Singleton, Don Messick and Mel Blanc, all series veterans, alongside Tiffany as Judy Jetson. The story follows George Jetson, who is tasked with running a new Spacely Sprockets facility by his boss Cosmo Spacely. However, after he brings his family along to support him, they uncover the tragic truth of the facility's location. The film was released on July 6, 1990. It grossed $20.3 million on a budget of $8 million during its theatrical run, though it was considered a box office disappointment and received mixed to mostly negative reviews. O'Hanlon and Blanc died during production of the film, which was dedicated to both their memories. Jetsons: The Movie was the last theatrical film to be directed by William Hanna and Joseph Barbera before their deaths, in 2001 and 2006 respectively. It was also the final Jetsons production until the release of The Jetsons & WWE: Robo-WrestleMania! in 2017. Although Warner Bros. Discovery owns the rights to the majority of the Hanna-Barbera library, including the rights to The Jetsons, the rights to this film are owned by Universal Pictures. This movie was falling into obscurity, so I decided to upload it here. One of the animators, Jon McClenahan realised it was the worst film of all time after seeing it in theatres, and Andrea Romano who is a talented voice director wanted her name uncredited but she is still credited..","title":"The Jetsons Movie (1990)"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"jetsons0000barb","subject":"Children's short stories in English, 1945- - Texts","description":["48 unnumbered pages","24 EPISODES OF SEASON ONE","STARRING GEORGE, JANE, JUDY, ELROY, AND ASTRO, AND ROSI THE ROBOTIC MAID"],"title":"The Jetsons"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"jetsonsonmove0000gave","description":"[24] p. : 21 cm","title":"Jetsons on the move"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"jetsonsonmove00gave","title":"Jetsons on the move"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"jetwarbirds0000olea","subject":["Jet planes, Military","Jet planes, Military -- Conservation and restoration"],"description":["128 p. : 27 cm","\"Sabres, MiGs, Hunters, and more civilian-owned military jets\"--Cover"],"title":"Jet warbirds"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"jetzthelfeichmir0000unse_o6x0","description":"270 S. 27 cm","title":"Jetzt helfe ich mir selbst Bd. 140.

Van pointed to where a 15-room hotel had been the heart of an active commercial hub. As he looked out the window of his feed, grain and hardware store on a recent gray day, a freight train rumbled past, gently shaking the building. It left town without stopping. \"When I was a kid, Abrams used to be bigger than Pulaski, bigger than Oconto Falls because it was a lumber town. The hotel had two barber shops, served three meals a day and was usually filled,\" said Van, 78, a community activist who has spent all but the first two years of his life in Abrams. Van recalled a time some 70 years ago when regular passenger train service conveyed salesmen from Milwaukee and Chicago to Abrams so they could cover their northern territories. The salesmen would stay in Abrams for weeks. Built on a foundation of agriculture, commerce and timber, Abrams thrived.","title":"Jobs Left Abrams, But Not The Spirit"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"jobs900000petr","subject":["Job hunting -- United States","Industries -- United States -- Directories","Employment forecasting -- United States","Economic forecasting -- United States","Economic forecasting","Employment forecasting","Industries","Job hunting","Berufsaussicht","Berufswahl","United States","USA"],"description":"viii, 584 pages ; 21 cm","title":"Jobs '90"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"jobsatisfactioni00grif","subject":["Teachers","Teacher participation in administration","Job satisfaction"],"description":"Click here to view the University of Florida catalog record","title":"Job satisfaction in shared decision-making schools : Herzberg's theory investigated"},{"date":"1990-06-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"jobsatisfactionw1094527719","subject":["Job satisfaction","Performance.","Military Entrance Processing Station (MEPS)","job satisfaction"],"description":"Job satisfaction has been linked to many variables, such as turnover, absenteeism, and productivity. Job satisfaction has rarely, however, been related to the quality of work that is produced on the job. At the various Military Entrance Processing Stations (MEPS) throughout the country, it is the quality of work rather than the quantity of work that is the critical issue. This study first examines the organizational structure and the duties and responsibilities of a MEPS, and then examines the correlation between job satisfaction and quality of performance. Correlations were found only in the Category III (small) MEPS and in Central Sector. Additionally, when the subjectivity of the Sector Commander's Assessment was eliminated from the MEPS Awards Program criteria, a significant correlation was indicated between job satisfaction and quality in the pooled MEPS data.","title":"Job satisfaction within the Military Entrance Processing Station and its relationship to quality of performance"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"jobsdaughterswom0000chit","subject":["Bible.
