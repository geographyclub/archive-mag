And your motifs are mostly bound by the movement of the choreography. So it is tricky to do. I always found it to be an exciting challenge. A friend of mine, who is a brilliant musician, expressed an interest in hearing some of this work. So I busted out one of these pieces. Although the actual recording is not the greatest, it\u2019s the only copy I currently posses of this piece. And, to give some idea of what the dance was about I placed some video of birds onto the music. I titled this piece Birds Exotica, it was written for a modern dance performance piece title Exotic Birds and was performed at the Eisenhower Dance company\u2019s resident performance venue (at Oakland University) back in Michigan in the early nineties. The dancers were dressed in exotic flowing costumes and floated and fluttered about the stage in recurring geometrical forms and groupings for all ten minutes and ten seconds of the piece. It was a beautiful dance piece. My wife Jodi was one of the lovely dancers (this was pre- marriage), which of course added to its luster. Regardless, I thought, what the heck, I put it together for my buddy J\u00f8rg to hear, why not share it with those of you who might be curious to hear... I used some traditional orchestra instruments, along with some other assortment of instrumentation, I would describe the music as Stravinsky meets Phillip Glass. Anyway. If you\u2019re interested in listening to this somewhat artful endeavor of mine from some years back, you are certainly welcome to do so. I will let you know in advance this is a somewhat abstract composition.","title":"Birds Exotica By John Reneaud"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"birds0000bail_n4w5","subject":["Birds -- Juvenile literature","Birds"],"description":["48 p. : 25 cm","Text and pictures introduce basic information about birds, their habits, and their behavior","\"Material used in this book first appeared in Macmillan world Library: On the wing, published by Macmillan Children's Books\"--T.p. verso"],"title":"Birds"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"birds0000gill","subject":["Birds -- Juvenile literature","Birds"],"description":["30 pages : 24 cm","Discusses the habitat, behavior, flight, appearance, reproduction, nesting, and migration of birds","Includes index"],"title":"Birds"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"birds0000gill_y1l9","subject":"Birds","description":"31 pages","title":"Birds"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"birds0000mead","subject":"Birds -- Juvenile literature","description":["32 p. : 21 x 23 cm","Includes bibliographical references (p. 31) and index"],"title":"Birds"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"birds0000thom","subject":["Birds -- Great Britain","Birds","Great Britain","Great Britain Birds"],"description":"48 unnumbered pages","title":"Birds"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"birds00coxr","subject":"Birds -- Juvenile literature","title":"Birds"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"birdsalad0000eliz","title":"Bird salad"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"birdsareanimals0000holl","subject":["Birds","Science"],"description":"17 unnumbered pages : 17 x 24 cm","title":"Birds are animals"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"birdsbees00bake","title":"The birds and the bees"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"birdseyeviewofma00robi","subject":["Birds","Bird watching"],"description":["\"Orig reproduced, 1986; rev. ed.

The company marketed it as a great birthday gift. About ten copies of the game were sold. The cartridge was sold with a three folded manual sheet. The cartridge has a red label with blue balloons on it and an empty space to write your name on. Each game is personalized to the boy or girl celebrating his or her birthday. When the game loads up it shows his or her name on the opening screen. The basic object of this game is to blow out candles as they fall toward you. here is nothing that sets\u00a0 Birthday Mania \u00a0apart from other games of its era by today's standards. However, because it is a hidden gem with few sales that\u00a0flew under the radar for many years, the game is worth upwards of $15,000 nowadays. While some may argue that\u00a0 Birthday Mania \u00a0is rarer than the NES\u00a0 Nintendo World Championships 1990 \u00a0cartridge, it is undoubtedly one of the rarest Atari games that any\u00a0 retro video game collector \u00a0would be honored to have in their collection. \u00a0","title":"Birthday Mania Rom"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"birthdayburglarv0000mahy","subject":["Birthdays -- Children's fiction","Schools -- Children's fiction","Birthdays","Schools"],"description":"144 pages : 23 cm","title":"The birthday burglar, &, A very wicked headmistress"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"birthdaysarenotf00osof","subject":"Nigeria -- Drama.","title":"Birthdays are not for dying : & other plays"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"birthdefectsency0000unse","subject":["Abnormalities, Human -- Dictionaries","Congenital Abnormalities"],"description":["lxxxi, 1892 pages : 29 cm","Includes bibliographical references and index"],"title":"Birth defects encyclopedia : the comprehensive, systematic, illustrated reference source for the diagnosis, delineation, etiology, biodynamics, occurrence, prevention, and treatment of human anomalies of clinical relevance"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"birthfertilityra0000lewi","subject":["Childbirth -- United States -- Statistics","Fertility, Human -- United States -- Statistics","Education -- United States -- Statistics","Childbirth","Education","Fertility, Human","Birth Rate","Educational Status","Fertility","Maternal Age","United States"],"description":["iv, 40 pages : 28 cm","By Caroline Lewis and Stephanie Ventura","\"October 1990.\"","Includes bibliographical references (page 10)"],"title":"Birth and fertility rates by education, 1980 and 1985"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"birthmarks0000unse","subject":"English drama","description":"114 pages ; 21 cm","title":"Birthmarks"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"birthofmoderncri0000scho","subject":["Bible -- Criticism, interpretation, etc. -- History -- 17th century","Bible -- Critique, interpre\u0301tation, etc. -- Histoire","Bible","Theology, Doctrinal -- History -- 17th century","Theology -- Methodology -- History -- 17th century","Religion and science -- History -- 17th century","Authority -- Religious aspects -- Christianity -- History of doctrines -- 17th century","The\u0301ologie dogmatique -- Histoire -- 17e sie\u0300cle","The\u0301ologie -- Me\u0301thodologie -- Histoire des doctrines -- 17e sie\u0300cle","Religion et sciences -- Histoire -- 17e sie\u0300cle","Autorite\u0301 -- Aspect religieux -- Histoire des doctrines -- 17e sie\u0300cle","Authority -- Religious aspects -- Christianity -- History of doctrines","Religion and science","Theology, Doctrinal","Theology -- Methodology","Bijbelkritiek","Bible Criticism"],"description":["184 pages ; 22 cm","\"Translated by John Bowden from the German: Urspru\u0308nge und Probleme der historisch-kritischen Theologie\"--Title page verso","Includes bibliographical references (pages 145-178) and index","Introduction : the rise of historical-critical theology as a problem for church history -- The Norm of faith in controversies between Catholics and Protestants -- The Relationship between reason, Scripture and dogma among the Socinians -- The Credibility of the Biblical picture of the world : I.

Features interviews with both Brian Croucher and Stephen Greif, as well as Chris Boucher (script editor), and producer David Maloney. Narrated by Peter Miles, who played Secretary Rontane. A drama-documentary based upon the life, times and creation of the character who was the second deadliest enemy of the Liberator crew. Combines actual sections of dialogue from the TV series and new contributions from individuals who had a part in the creation of Travis and from the two actors who played him. Presented in two parts, it opens with the character of Rontane (played superbly once more by Peter Miles) setting out information about the origins of Travis following Supreme Commander Servalan's decision to choose the unorthodox officer to hunt down Blake. Rontane accesses a Federation computer, which proceeds to give him the facts that he requires, via a series of interviews with producer David Maloney, script editor Chris Boucher, and actors Steven Grief and Brian Croucher. It traces the history of Travis, from both a factual and fictional point of view. David Maloney discusses the ideas surrounding the casting of the actors and the general production of the series, but Chris Boucher's contribution is by far the most interesing part. Boucher talks about what made Travis Travis, and looks at his motives and beliefs. One of the main points highlighted by Boucher is that Travis's main reason for being is that he is a soldier. He has been trained to be a soldier, and this is all he knows: his only family is the military. Another interesting idea concerns his relationship with Servalan - for despite all of the disagreements and conflict between the pair, Boucher tells us that Travis could never have killed the Supreme Commander, because he simply could not kill a superior officer due to the type of person that he was. Both Steven Grief and Brian Croucher talk about playing the role, and it is the latter who makes the largest contribution of the two, probably because more happened to Travis in Season Two than in Season One. Croucher seems to have enjoyed playing Travis, and gives some interesting anecdotes about his time in B7. During the second season the incompetance of Travis leads to his dismissal, his trial, and his eventual short-lived alliance with the Andromedans.

For the next several years, she taught English, art, and domestic science on the Rosebud, Pine Ridge, and Cheyenne River reservations. In return for her friendship, the students affectionately gave her the name Blue Star.

The game is not unlike other platform games of the era. Though it's unique in that you can climb walls and swing on rope with your teeth and your only method of attack is head butting enemies - straight forward or dive bomb style. The game starts off with simplistic point A to point B style, but focuses more on exploration in the later stages, which include finding hidden bonus areas. The game is also known for its trademark gameplay mechanism of 'spin attack', where Bonk floats through the air if you have the turbo button on. This can be used to float around the level and reach areas for extra\/hidden items, but also as a method of attack as well. The game starts you off with 3 hearts, but allows you to increase this number when you find special heart container items, allowing Bonk to take a number of hits before dying. A variety of bonus stages can be found throughout the game, which provide bonus points upon completion and thus resulting in accumulating extra lives. Enemies themselves can be 'milked' for points in that you can keep 'bonking' their dead bodies and not letting them hit the ground. Spin attack is another method for doing this.","title":"Bonk's Adventure (Turbografx-16)"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"bonkgoesball0000stev","subject":["Balls (Sporting goods) -- Fiction","Soccer -- Fiction"],"description":["29 p. : 19 cm","A ball is hit, kicked, chased, passed, and sent through a goal during a soccer game"],"title":"Bonk! goes the ball"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"bonkiegreatbankb0000seam","title":"Bonkie the Great Bank Blagger"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"bonnenuitbabar0000unse","description":["[8] pages : 19 cm","Pour enfants","Titre de la couverture"],"title":"Bonne nuit Babar"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"bonner-zoologische-beitraege-41-0001-0002","title":"40 Jahre \"Bonner zoologische Beitr\u00e4ge\""},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"bonner-zoologische-beitraege-41-0003-0008","title":"Small Indian mongoose Herpestes auropunctatus (Hodgson, 1836) on the Adriatic Islands of Yugoslavia"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"bonner-zoologische-beitraege-41-0009-0022","title":"Die Verbreitung einiger Fledermausarten in Griechenland"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"bonner-zoologische-beitraege-41-0023-0026","title":"The food of the tawny owl (Strix aluco L.) from near a bat cave in Poland"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"bonner-zoologische-beitraege-41-0027-0058","title":"\u00d6ko-ethologische Beobachtungen am Nest der Kleinralle (Porzana parva)"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"bonner-zoologische-beitraege-41-0059-0062","title":"Nesting of the Manx Shearwater (Puffinus puffinus Br\u00fcnnich, 1764) on the Island of Tenerife (Canary Islands)"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"bonner-zoologische-beitraege-41-0063-0079","title":"Shallow-water Pycnogonida from Kenya and Sri Lanka, with descriptions of three new species"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"bonner-zoologische-beitraege-41-0081-0087","title":"Considerations about Ocnerodrilus occidentalis (Oligochaeta: Ocnerodrilidae) in the Canary Islands"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"bonner-zoologische-beitraege-41-0089-0093","title":"Buchbesprechungen"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"bonner-zoologische-beitraege-41-0095-0107","title":"The morphology of the syrinx in the Charadriiformes (Aves): Possible phylogenetic implications"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"bonner-zoologische-beitraege-41-0109-0112","title":"Variation in the Cinnamon-breasted Warbler of the South West Arid Zone of the Afrotropics"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"bonner-zoologische-beitraege-41-0113-0120","title":"Kleine S\u00e4ugetiere aus r\u00f6mischen Brunnen des Legionslagers Oberaden, Bergkamen"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"bonner-zoologische-beitraege-41-0121-0139","title":"Geographic Variation in Microtus nivalis (Martins, 1842) from Austria and Yugoslavia"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"bonner-zoologische-beitraege-41-0141-0156","title":"Principal component and PLS discriminant analyses applied on skulls of European shrews of the genus Sorex (Mammalia, Soricidae)"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"bonner-zoologische-beitraege-41-0157-0162","title":"On the biology of Baloghella melis Mahunka, 1963 (Acari: Acaridida: Glycyphagidae)"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"bonner-zoologische-beitraege-41-0163-0169","title":"Species, class and individual characteristics in the African Wattled Starling, Creatophora cinerea"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"bonner-zoologische-beitraege-41-0171-0179","title":"Die Waldohreule (Asio otus) in \u00c4gypten"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"bonner-zoologische-beitraege-41-0181-0202","title":"Zum Vorkommen einiger in der T\u00fcrkei seltener Vogelarten"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"bonner-zoologische-beitraege-41-0203-0212","title":"Taxonomy and evolution of the North African ocellated lizard, Lacerta pater (Lataste, 1880) (Sauria: Lacertidae)"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"bonner-zoologische-beitraege-41-0213-0222","title":"Leptopsylla algira vogeli n. ssp.

Data for this study consists of aircraft data averaged over one minute supplimented by satellite and drifting buoy observations. Analysis of surface winds and fluxes was done using the Brown-Liu Marine PBL model. Results show a PBL which differs from that found in typical cyclones, with large latent heat fluxes south of the warm front and with relatively weak sensible heat fluxes about the warm front. Boundary layer stratification was stable north of the warm front and unstable south of the warm front. A mechanism for moist frontogenesis is proposed whereby the destabilizing effects of the latent heat flux enhances frictional convergence along the warm front. These fluxes warm and moisten the cyclone's warm sector, enhancing unstable convection along the warm front and thereby enhancing the vertical motion. This enhanced vertical motion would strengthen the geostrophic deformation of the theta sub epsilon gradient and potentially enhance cyclogenesis.","title":"Boundary layer structure of an explosive cyclone"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"boundaryvaluepro0000weng","subject":["Boundary value problems","Differential equations, Elliptic"],"description":["xii, 411 p. ; 24 cm","Includes bibliographical references (p. 384-402) and index"],"title":"Boundary value problems for elliptic equations and systems"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"boundarywatersfi0000furt","subject":["Fishing -- Minnesota -- Boundary Waters Canoe Area -- Guidebooks","Boundary Waters Canoe Area (Minn.) -- Guidebooks"],"description":"200 p. : 22 cm","title":"A boundary waters fishing guide"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"boundforblissclo00","subject":"Single mothres","title":"Bound for bliss"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"boundforblisshar00kris","subject":"Single mothres","title":"Bound for bliss"},{"date":"1990-12-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"boundsonextremeg00farg","subject":"EIGENVALUES.","description":["Title from cover","\"NPS-62-90-016.\"","\"December 1990.\"","AD A233 517","Includes bibliographical references (p. 14)","We present easily computable bounds on the extreme generalized eigenvalues of Hermitian pencils (R,B) with finite eigenvalues and positive definite B matrices.

Tr\u00e8s proche du texte de Gustave Flaubert , cette fiction a re\u00e7u le 7 d'or de la meilleure fiction, en 1991 . Par un chaud dimanche d'\u00e9t\u00e9, pr\u00e8s du bassin du port de l'Arsenal , sur le boulevard Bourdon , \u00e0 Paris, deux promeneurs, Bouvard et P\u00e9cuchet, se rencontrent par hasard sur un banc public et font connaissance. Ils s'aper\u00e7oivent qu'ils ont eu tous deux l'id\u00e9e d'\u00e9crire leur nom dans leur chapeau\u00a0: \u00ab\u00a0Alors ils se consid\u00e9r\u00e8rent.\u00a0\u00bb . Tomb\u00e9s sous le charme l'un de l'autre, Bouvard et P\u00e9cuchet d\u00e9couvrent que non seulement ils exercent le m\u00eame m\u00e9tier de copiste , mais qu'en plus ils ont les m\u00eames centres d'int\u00e9r\u00eat. S'ils le pouvaient, ils aimeraient vivre \u00e0 la campagne. Un h\u00e9ritage opportun de Bouvard va leur permettre de changer de vie. Ils reprennent une ferme \u00e0 Chavignolles, dans le Calvados , non loin de Caen et se lancent, sans autre pr\u00e9paration que la lecture d'ouvrages de vulgarisation et des conseils pratiques glan\u00e9s au hasard, dans l' agriculture ( agronomie , arboriculture , jardinage , conserverie , distillerie ). Leur enthousiasme de n\u00e9ophytes et leur incapacit\u00e9 \u00e0 comprendre va n'engendrer que des d\u00e9sastres. De la m\u00eame mani\u00e8re, ils vont s'int\u00e9resser, successivement, aux sciences ( chimie , anatomie , physiologie , m\u00e9decine , nutrition , astronomie , zoologie , g\u00e9ologie ), \u00e0 l' arch\u00e9ologie ( architecture , mus\u00e9ologie , religion celtique , antiquit\u00e9s , histoire , biographie ), \u00e0 la litt\u00e9rature ( roman historique , th\u00e9\u00e2tre , critique litt\u00e9raire , grammaire , esth\u00e9tique ), \u00e0 la politique , \u00e0 l' amour , \u00e0 la philosophie ( gymnastique , spiritisme , magn\u00e9tisme , logique ), \u00e0 la religion , \u00e0 l' \u00e9ducation ( phr\u00e9nologie , dessin , histoire naturelle , morale , musique , urbanisme ) avec les m\u00eames r\u00e9sultats. Ils sont aussi emport\u00e9s dans les d\u00e9bats, souvent houleux, de la politique \u2014 l'action se d\u00e9roule apr\u00e8s la r\u00e9volution de 1848 \u2014, de la religion, du positivisme. Comme dans les autres domaines, leurs opinions sont aussi peu assur\u00e9es et peu enracin\u00e9es que possible. Ils ne connaissent rien que par quelques poncifs tir\u00e9s de leurs lectures. Le roman s'interrompt brusquement au chapitre dix sur l'\u00e9chec \u00e9ducatif de Bouvard et P\u00e9cuchet, les deux \u00ab\u00a0orphelins\u00a0\u00bb dont ils ont volontairement assum\u00e9 la charge et entrepris l'\u00e9ducation se montrant totalement r\u00e9tifs \u00e0 leur p\u00e9dagogie (pourtant inspir\u00e9e des meilleurs auteurs). La fin\u00a0? Le manuscrit de Flaubert contient un plan de la fin du roman, o\u00f9 l'on voit que lass\u00e9s par tant d'\u00e9checs, abandonn\u00e9s par les orphelins, il leur vient une derni\u00e8re id\u00e9e\u00a0: \u00ab\u00a0copier comme autrefois\u00a0\u00bb, et ils font venir de Paris de quoi fabriquer un bureau.

Many residents work in Green Bay and Sturgeon Bay. In the community, Van's Lumber and Hardware, Route 4, Luxemburg, employs about 65 people. Other Dyckesville businesses include gas stations, motels, restaurants, a grocery store, bank, cabinet shop and beauty shop. Once a farming community, but is now home to blue- and white-collar workers. One historical account says mission priests camped in Dyckesville as early as 1679. Belgian immigrants arrived in 1853.

Bruchan himself was far more than he seemed. A master of the mysterious Brotherhood of the Wolf, descendant of a royal line, he had sought someone like Aengus. Now he would train the boy, not just in art, but in weapons and literature. He would lead him along secret pathways of prophecy in the belief that Aengus was the one whose coming had been foretold. But there was a shift in the balance of four ancient Powers. At every turn deceptions and murderous enemies awaited Aengus. Unless his newfound skills could loose other Powers, the dark fury of the Wolf would surely consume him..","351 pages ; 18 cm"],"title":"The boy from the burren : the first book of the Painter"},{"date":"1990-12-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"boyhisdonkeyst00caro","subject":["Schools","Audio: Juvenile"],"title":"The Boy & His Donkey ((Stepping Into English Ser.; Level VI))"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"boyhowdy0000boyd","subject":"Texas -- Social life and customs -- Humor","description":"ix, 127 p. : 23 cm","title":"Boy, howdy!"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"boyinair0000baje","subject":["English fiction","United States"],"description":"141p. ; 22cm","title":"Boy in the air"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"boyinmoonana00rona","subject":"Friendship","description":"High school senior Nick feels his universe breaking up around him as his relationship with his two lifelong friends Kevin and Frieda threatens to change","title":"The boy in the moon"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"boyjesus0000newm","subject":["Jesus Christ -- Childhood","Goliath -- Juvenile literature","Bible stories, English -- O.T.

The first section describes and critiques the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR); the second analyzes the U.S. application of MTCR guidelines toward Brazil; the third assesses Brazil's ballistic missile capabilities; and the fourth considers Brazil's response. The report concludes that the U.S. policy of restricting space and missile technology to Brazil under the MTCR has succeeded in stalling Brazil's missile program, but has also (1) further strained Brazilian security relations with the United States; (2) weakened U.S. influence over Brazil's rocket and missile programs; (3) strengthened Brazilian ties with European suppliers (especially France) of space and missile technology; (4) driven Brazil into closer technological cooperation with the People's Republic of China and the Soviet Union; and (5) intensified Brazilian negotiations with Iraq and Libya. As Brazil moves away from the United States (its traditional supplier of space and missile technology), it is becoming relatively more autonomous and less vulnerable to U.S. restrictions on space and missile technology. The successful implementation of an internationalist development strategy by Brazil's new president, Fernando Collor de Mello, could provide the United States with an exceptional opportunity to improve relations with Brazil. The United States could possibly negotiate the easing of MTCR restrictions on space technology to Brazil without jeopardizing the goal of ballistic missile non- proliferation.

The books in the series cover major cancer diseases in writing designed specifically for general practitioners in the European Community countries. The texts are prepared and edited by the European School of Oncology (ESO) for the Commission of the European Communities. Each book will be published in each of the official languages of the European Community. The books all follow the same basic design. The first part, which can be read in as little as fifteen minutes, summarizes various aspects under relevant questions. The second part focuses on practical problems as they appear to the general practitioner in day-by-day practice. Selected references to recent textbooks and monographs complete the brief discussion and point the interested individual to further reading. Breast cancer is the most frequent neoplastic disease among European women. The importance of the general practitioner's role, especially in the early diagnosis of breast cancer, is underscored in this second volume of the EC Series for General Practitioners","First Part -- Key questions on breast cancer -- Second Part -- Epidemiology of breast cancer -- Diagnosis and staging -- Pathology -- Treatment: General strategy -- Surgery -- Radiotherapy -- Adjuvant systemic therapy -- Treatment of overt metastatic disease -- Rehabilitation -- Psychological aspects -- References"],"title":"Breast Cancer : Textbook for General Practitioners"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"breastcervicalca00unit","subject":["Breast","Uterus","Cancer","Federal aid to medical centers","Breast -- Cancer -- United States -- Prevention","Uterus -- Cancer -- United States -- Prevention","Cancer -- Mortality -- United States","Federal aid to medical centers -- United States"],"description":["CMS copy in folder: Public Laws: 101st Congress \/ 2nd Session \/ House Reports \/ 1990","Caption title","Distributed to some depository libraries in microfiche","Shipping list no.: 90-426-P","\"June 18, 1990.\"","21 p. ; 24 cm"],"title":"Breast and Cervical Cancer Mortality Prevention Act of 1990 : report (to accompany H.R. 4790) (including cost estimate of the Congressional Budget Office)"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"breastpathologyb0000fech","subject":["{u'11': u'Maladie fibrokystique du sein -- Anatomopathologie -- Atlas', u'10': u'E\\u0301pithe\\u0301lioma in situ -- Anatomopathologie -- Atlas', u'12': u'Hyperplasie -- Anatomopathologie -- Atlas', u'17': u'Mamma', u'16': u'Krankheit', u'1': u'Breast -- Needle biopsy', u'0': u'Breast -- Tumors -- Diagnosis', u'3': u'Breast -- pathology', u'2': u'Breast -- Histopathology', u'5': u'Carcinoma in Situ -- pathology', u'4': u'Breast Neoplasms -- pathology', u'7': u'Hyperplasia -- pathology', u'6': u'Fibrocystic Breast Disease -- pathology', u'9': u'Tumeurs du sein -- Anatomopathologie -- Atlas', u'8': u'Sein -- Anatomopathologie -- Atlas'}","Breast -- Tumors -- Diagnosis","Breast -- Needle biopsy","Breast -- Histopathology","Breast -- pathology","Breast Neoplasms -- pathology","Carcinoma in Situ -- pathology","Fibrocystic Breast Disease -- pathology","Hyperplasia -- pathology","Sein -- Anatomopathologie -- Atlas","Tumeurs du sein -- Anatomopathologie -- Atlas","Epithelioma in situ -- Anatomopathologie -- Atlas","Maladie fibrokystique du sein -- Anatomopathologie -- Atlas","Hyperplasie -- Anatomopathologie -- Atlas","Krankheit","Mamma"],"description":["vii, 182 pages : 32 cm +","\"Key to optional slide set\": pages 173-178","Includes bibliographical references and index"],"title":"Breast pathology : benign proliferations, atypias, & in situ carcinomas"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"breatbooks0034unse","subject":["Swift, Jonathan","Voltaire","Diderot, Denis","Literature -- Collections","Literature"],"description":["xxi, 303 pages","Contents: Gulliver's travels \/ Jonathan Swift -- Candide \/ Voltaire -- Rameau's nephew \/ Denis Diderot"],"title":"Great books of the western world. 34.

The recording contains significant echo\/reverb owing to the cavernous church in which it was recorded. Grand Scherzo - very much in the style of the Chopin Scherzos, particularly Nos. 1 and 2. Interlude in g minor - reminiscent of a Bach-style prelude. Interlude in C - again in a baroque contrapuntal style, with the added attraction that the piece travels through all the major keys in its short duration. Interlude in f minor - a somewhat more mature work with tones of late Beethoven, romanticism, and modern pop. Etude of Remembrance - my best, favorite and most original work up until that time. Pulsing, atmospheric minimalism, including direct quotations of Schubert. The murky acoustics here add to the effect in this case. Independence Rag - classic James Scott-like ragtime; also inspired by the lyric simplicity of Bolcom's \"Through Eden's Gates\". -- Brian Keenan","title":"Brian Keenan Original Piano Compositions 1990 Tape"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"brianboruemperor0000llyw","subject":["Brian, King of Ireland, 926-1014 -- Fiction","Brian, King of Ireland, 926-1014","Kings and rulers","Ireland -- History -- To 1172 -- Fiction","Ireland -- Kings and rulers -- Fiction","Ireland"],"description":["214 pages ; 17 cm","This is the story of Brian Boru a real life hero who changed the distiny of Ireland and who revolutionized 10th century Ireland","\"A Tom Doherty Associates Book.\""],"title":"Brian Boru, emperor of the Irish"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"brianboruemperor0000llyw_p5u9","subject":["Brian, King of Ireland, 926-1014 -- Fiction","Brian, King of Ireland, 926-1014","Boru, Brian, approximately 941-1014","Kings and rulers","Ireland -- Kings and rulers -- Fiction","Ireland -- History -- To 1172 -- Fiction","Ireland","Ireland History, 410-1086"],"description":"160 pages ; 20 cm","title":"Brian Boru : emperor of the Irish"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"brianfriel0000obri","subject":["Friel, Brian","Friel, Brian -- Criticism and interpretation","Friel, Brian 1929-2015","Ireland -- In literature","Literature","Ireland"],"description":["xii, 148 pages : 23 cm","Includes bibliographical references (pages 138-145) and index"],"title":"Brian Friel"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"brianfrielirelan0000pine","subject":["Friel, Brian -- Criticism and interpretation","Ireland in literature","National characteristics, Irish, in literature","Northern Ireland in literature"],"description":["xii, 260 p. ; 22 cm","Includes bibliographical references (p. 253-254) and index"],"title":"Brian Friel and Ireland's drama"},{"date":"1990-03-15T00:00:00Z","identifier":"briangrahamflex-4","subject":["Troy Zuccolotto, 1989 Nationals Championships, Muscle Training, Gym, Muscle Show","Mercury Morris Claiborne","Brian Graham."],"description":"Publisher: Flex (US)\u00a0 \u00a0 March 15 1990, Vol. 8, Iss. 1, pg. 56,57, by: Bill Reynolds, \"1989 NPC National Championships\"","title":"Brian Graham Flex 4"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"brianmoore0000unse","title":"brian moore"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"briansibleybring0000sibl","subject":["Lewis, C.

Indeed, the authors compare 1) the permeability of geological substrates and 2) the composition of superficial formations in which brown leached soils and pseudogleys have formed. They establish that the differentiation of these two pedogeneses migh result from the \"remote\" action of two deep geological substrata with a totally different permeability into superficial materials having an equivalent composition. The authors reache conclusions as to the age of the leached brown soils and pseudogleys the differentiation of which seems to be spatial and no longuer temporal.","title":"Brunification et pseudogleyification en fonction de la perm\u00e9abilit\u00e9 du substratum g\u00e9ologique"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"bruderluckhardtu0000unse","subject":["Luckhardt, Hans, 1890-1954 -- Exhibitions","Luckhardt, Wassili, 1889-1972 -- Exhibitions","Anker, Alfons, 1872-1958 -- Exhibitions","Architecture -- Germany -- Berlin -- History -- 20th century -- Exhibitions","Architects -- Germany -- Berlin -- Biography"],"description":["320 p. : 23 cm","\"Publikation der Abteilung Baukunst der Akademie der Ku\u0308nste, Berlin, anla\u0308sslich der Ausstellung 'Bruder Luckhardt und Alfons Anker' vom 2.

Is the Piranesi Vase an eighteenthcentury masterpiece or a fakedup antique? Fakes, argue the contributors to this volume, have always been unjustly neglected, especially given the unparalleled evidence they provide of the values and perceptions of both those who make them and those who commission them.Included in this major survey of fakes and forgeries from ancient Babylonia to the present day are more than 600 objects from the British Museum and other outstanding collections. There are spectacular fakes once hailed as masterpieces of ancient and modern art. There are musical instruments and manuscripts, Chinese bronzes and Chelsea porcelain. There are literary and documentary frauds and political forgeries that have changed the course of history. Both the methods of making fakes and the recent scientific advances in their detection are described, but many puzzles remain. The book concludes with a discussion of intriguing cases like the Vinland Map, the Aztec rockcrystal skull, and the mysterious discoveries at Glozel, which continue to perplex curator, historian, and scientist alike.

Encounters and Reflections brings together many of his recent critical writingson artists such as Andy Warhol, David Hockney, and Robert Mapplethorpe; and on the significance of issues like the masterpiece and the museum. The result is a spirited brief from the front lines of current aesthetic and philosophical debate.","Originally published: New York : Farrar, Straus & Giroux, 1990","Includes index"],"title":"Encounters & reflections : art in the historical present"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"bub_gb_bTpJsNLKPQYC","subject":["bub_upload","Fishes"],"description":"Que es la atraccion con luz; Por que atraer a los peces; Cuando funciona la atraccion con la luz; Que clases de peces se capturan mediante la atraccion con la luz; Equipo necessario para la atraccion con luz; Le conviene utilizar la atraccion con luz?; Es bueno este metodo para los peces?; Como afecta la luz al comportamiento de los peces; La luz en el agua; Lamparas pequenas o grandes?; Refraccion de la luz en el agua; Las lamparas de pesca comunes; Puesta en funcionamiento de las lamparas; Cuidado de las lamparas de pesca; Iluminacion nocturna; Ecosondeo; Cuando colocar las luces; Cuanto tiempo mantener instaladas las luces; Cuanto pescado hay?; Utilizacion de ecosondas para saber cuanto pescado acude a la luz; Diversas formas de pescar con luz; La pesca con red de enmalle y con luz; La pesca con redes izadas y con luz; La pesca con artes de playa y con luz, La pesca con rede de cerco de jareta y con luz; Diversas formas de pescar con redes de cerco de jareta usando la luz.","title":"La atraccio\u0301n de peces con luz"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"bub_gb_crCQmS_85EEC","subject":"bub_upload","description":"A new departure in the study of the history of the Spanish Inquisition. . . .

The enemies must be cleared from a level to go to the next one. With one player controlling Bub and the other controlling Bob, the player can jump and collect items for points (such as fruit). The real power Bub and Bob have however is the ability to blow bubbles. These bubbles can be as platforms to leap on, or to trap enemies. Enemies trapped in a bubble must be popped by jumping into them, wherein they'll turn to fruit. Additionally, power-ups sometimes float by in bubbles. They include lightning, which flies out horizontally at enemies, and water, which drags the player and enemies straight down flowing over platforms. Taking too long to complete any level will summon Baron Von Blubba, who will float around the screen trying to destroy the player.","title":"Bubble Bobble (Gameboy)"},{"date":"1990-08-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"buccaneers-1990-media-guide-tampa-bay-c","subject":["Media Guide","Tampa Bay Buccaneers","National Football League (NFL)","records in sports","Record & Fact books","1990s","Football","Football--history","Sports--History","Media Guides","media guides--NFL","media guides--1990s","NFL Football--1990"],"description":"A media guide produced by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in preparation for the 1990 National Football League (NFL) season.

Colonies drift through the upper regions of the Jupiter gas clouds and cities have been carved out of asteroids. Mars, the seat of power among the inner worlds, is home to the powerful, despotic Russo-American Mercantile (RAM). Its goal. The enslavement of the solar system. But what of Earth? The ancestral home of mankind now struggles to overcome the devastation of war and pollu- tion. All hope for a return to its former glory lies with a daring band of rebels, the New Earth Organization (NEO) led by Buck Rogers. Now, you and the members of your team can join Buck and his allies to rid the solar system of RAM tyranny! COUNTDOWN TO DOOMSDAY is a detailed computer role-playing game based on TSR's new BUCK ROGERS\u00ae XXVc role-playing system, and uses a specially enhanced version of SSl's award-winning AD&D\u00ae computer fantasy role-playing system Assemble a team of Rocketjocks, Warriors, Engineers, Rogues and Medics, recruited from Terrans. Martians, Venusians, Mercurians or genet- ically engineered Desert Runners and Tinkers. As your team explores the solar system, char- acters gain valuable skills such as piloting, zero-G maneuvering or demolition. These skills can prove more valuable than a good laser pistol in the toxic atmosphere of Venus or the sun-blasted surface of Mercury. But hang on to that laser pistol!

The thesis examines the following budgetary issues: (1) the trends and impact of budget cuts on DODDON appropriation accounts; (2) projected DODDON budget alternatives for FY 1992 through FY 1997; (3) the effect budget reductions have on the DODDON budgeting relative to criteria developed from two theoretical models of fiscal reduction methodology.","title":"Budget reduction in the Navy"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"budgiesasnewpet00mart","subject":"Budgerigar","description":["\"TU-004\"--Spine","Includes index"],"title":"Budgies as a new pet"},{"date":"1990-09-25T00:00:00Z","identifier":"budokanthemartialspiritsep251990prototype","subject":["sega","mega","drive","genesis","prototype","eprom","rom","hidden","palace"],"description":"Unreleased release candidate for a second revision with grammar and code fixes.

The United Mine Workers' recent victory in the Pittston strike depended on alliances with other unions and coalitions with various community groups. Building Bridges is a very helpful guide to the kind of coalition building unions will need in the struggles that lie ahead.\"\u00a0 -Richard L. Trumka, President,\u00a0 United Mine Workers of America \"Building Bridges is an important confirmation of what many of us sense-that the persistent push of progressive labor and grassroots activists to form coalitions is paying off. As they grow and forge ties across the country, these local efforts are not only helping to save our jobs and communities but are also revitalizing labor and social movements.\"\u00a0 -Sandy Pope, Executive Director,\u00a0 Coalition of Labor Union Women \"This is an extremely important collection of how-to-do-it essays which should be as useful in organizing daily struggles as it is in helping us to think about reshaping the society we live in .\"\u00a0 -David Montgomery, labor historian, Yale University \"Fragmented,\" \"isolated\" - such terms are often used to describe U.S. social movements today. But over the past few years, once-insular movements have been reaching out to cooperate at the grassroots level.

Bullet in the Head was originally planned to be a prequel to A Better Tomorrow but a falling out between Woo and producer Tsui Hark prevented this from happening. Woo reworked the script into what it is today, and Tsui made his own prequel, A Better Tomorrow III. After the breakup with his partnership with Tsui, Woo was having trouble finding backing for his films; stories have circulated that Tsui (one of the most powerful men in Hong Kong cinema) said Woo was hard to work with, and this led to his virtual blacklisting. At any rate, Woo financed almost all of the cost of the movie out of his own pocket. Woo rewrote much of the script to incorporate his reaction to the 1989 incident in Tiananmen Square in Beijing. Woo has described this project as his equivalent of Apocalypse Now, as it had the same exhausting and draining effect on him as that film had on Francis Ford Coppola. The cost of the film was around US$3.5 million, the highest budget for a Hong Kong film at the time. Like Woo's previous film, The Killer, this film did not do well in Hong Kong because audiences didn't like the allusions to the Tiananmen Square protests during the riot scenes. Woo was deeply affected by the shootings and felt bad that he touched such a raw nerve in people, but at the same time he felt the Chinese people should react and not hide from it. The Vietnam exteriors were shot in Thailand, and the interiors were shot in Hong Kong at the Cinema City Studio. It was deemed too expensive to shoot the nightclub shootout in Thailand. The helicopter footage used in the camp raid was a mixture of stock footage from the Vietnam War, as well as scenes from another Vietnam film. During the filming of some of the riot sequences, things got so chaotic on the set that John Woo panicked and ran into several shots. Once, he actually ran into an explosion, which caused large cuts on his head. Simon Yam actually burnt his face during the POW camp sequence.","title":"\u558b\u8840\u8857\u982d Bullet In The Head (1990) by John Woo"},{"date":"1990-06-15T00:00:00Z","identifier":"bulletdallas1990heri","subject":["Numismatics","Numismatics","Auctions"],"description":"Bullet Auction: Held in conjunction with the 1990 Dallas Coin and Stamp Expo by Heritage Numismatic Auctions, Inc.","title":"Bullet Auction: Held in conjunction with the 1990 Dallas Coin and Stamp Expo"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"bulletforstonewa00king","subject":["Jackson, Stonewall, 1824-1863","Chancellorsville, Battle of, Chancellorsville, Va., 1863","Generals"],"title":"A bullet for Stonewall : a novel"},{"date":"1990-04-20T00:00:00Z","identifier":"bulletftworth1990heri","subject":["Numismatics","Numismatics","Auctions"],"description":"Bullet Auction: Held in conjunction with the 32nd Convention of the Texas Numismatic Association, Inc., by Heritage Numismatic Auctions, Inc.","title":"Bullet Auction: Held in conjunction with the 32nd Convention of the Texas Numismatic Association, Inc."},{"date":"1990-02-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"bulletin-26","subject":"Bulletin","description":"Subterranea Britannica is a UK-based society for all those interested in man-made and man-used underground structures and space.

You shouldn\u2019t play it all the same. Not weak. Sixteenth notes should be played like sixteenth notes and eighth notes should be played like eighth notes. This is basic. Sixteenth notes are very light notes. Those, you are playing wrong.\u00a0 Play each note very carefully, don\u2019t fall down. Play always above the keyboard. Never use thumb hitting. Mistake, big mistake, not good. Move thumb sideways, take.\u00a0 Left hand: play down up down up\u2026never play the chords the same. I saw the previous lesson 4-hands. They were using the metronome, weren\u2019t they? But before actually using the metronome, it\u2019s much quicker if you teach how to get the rhythm. The tempo won\u2019t be wrong if you know the rhythm correctly. Then you can do it. You should teach well how to play the same notes. Have you seen the video tape of 10 pianos. I did not use the metronome at all. What we have to teach is how to feel the rhythm. The sound is leaned on when you go up and down with your wrist dropped down. Play into the keys. Don\u2019t use the edge. Don\u2019t have a dent in hand. You should practice like this; so that problem will be fixed.\u00a0 You should always look at your music score. I\u2019m sure your teacher will be able to point it out for you. ---------- 5-02.

The LSD for the 'acid test' parties was originally obtained from government sources. The Hippie Family Mafia since it's inception ca. 1964, has always had associations with, including funding, and support from the US Intelligence Community. The HFM operates as a pro-government militia often transporting narcotics on behalf of US Federal representatives, or assist in engaging political murders, etc. The US DOJ officially denies its existence, in spite of numerous first hand historical accounts regarding its activities; and former members speaking out about its practices. The term is a loose label to describe persons involved in drug trafficking activities covertly on behalf of the United States Intelligence Community, rather than a structured organization; with its roots in the MKULTRA series of experiments during the 1950's. More specifically it refers to persons associated with the Merry Pranksters, and by proxy the Grateful Dead (Political Warfare;) whom are directly involved in such activities. These people operate with the cover, and assistance of the US Government when engaging in criminal enterprise. HA Murray described the possible applications, and recruitment strategies of such an organization in his book Explorations in Personality, (and by extension MI Stein's book the Study of Lives.) The Bronx Project has dedicated itself to exploring the truth behind these mysteries, which have gutted the West Coast of the US between 1964 and 2012. Their primary operating area originally stretches from approx. San Francisco \/ Redding California to Nelson British Columbia. Many are well represented in media and entertainment, as well as Department of State organizations. Speaking openly about the group, it's history, and activities is life endangering. These organizations are an extension of similar programs which operated in Colombia during it's civil war (as well as Chile,) wherein the US covertly sponsored terror organizations such as the AUC in the name of it's fight against the global communist menace. The tactics of this organization were forerunners to Adversarial Operational Psychology techniques used in enhanced interrogation, and clean torture. Members of HFM have much higher conditional viability compared to normal populace when challenged with the use of such techniques with intent to cause an ego-fragmentation event (Project Mercury.) Multiple auto-biographies can be found on the topic. HFM are treated as Warrant Officers by the Pentagon, and operate as a Special Forces Detachment group. The recent legalization of cannabis in the U.S. appears to be a policy of accomodation (vs. repression) in response to this group's growing political, and economic power. HFM agents are not compensated, but are pressed into service often using extortion, and blackmail even for services rendered while in their employ. When agents are no longer useful, or no longer follow orders, they are tortured, murdered, and disappeared; with official narratives describing them as hallucinating and paranoid, often likely owing in part to the massive amounts of LSD administered to victims shortly before their murder \/ disappearance. This setup gives the US Federal Government plausible deniability for unlawful covert operations using HFM as a fence, and negates any need to compensate these persons for their services to the US Government, or injuries occurred during their service, creating a dual-economy, or modern day slave state for these bonded men. The use of slave labor by the Department of Defense, has created a National Security threat for the US as victims of these practices seek retribution; and are qualified to engage in such activities. \"The United States Information Agency (USIA), which operated from 1953 to 1999, was a United States agency devoted to public diplomacy.\" ---- \"The detachment warrant officer serves as the Assistant Detachment Commander or commands in the absence of the Detachment Commander during split-team operations and may command during composite team operations. The Assistant Detachment Commander provides technical, tactical, and operational expertise; provides advice and assistance to the Detachment Commander and detachment personnel across the special operations continuum; and is an experienced subject-matter expert in Unconventional Warfare.\" ---- \"T he CIA has become a global organization with its operatives masterminding terror and sabotage attacks worldwide, frequently using the intelligence services of other countries.\" - Dmitry Belik, member of the State Duma Committee on International Affairs (2023) ---- In spite of providing US Department of Justice components sufficient physical evidence for prosecution of cases related to this group, the US DOJ National Security division (death squads) refuse to open investigation into of these activities. ---- \"In Euripides' play The Bacchae, maenads of Thebes murder King Pentheus after he bans the worship of Dionysus.\" ---- Also see: [Chuck Palahniuk (Rant)] [Burning Man] [Hippie Family Mafia (HFM): 'Grateful Dead Family'] [Chthonic Cult] [Winged Sun] [Anarchism] [Political Warfare] [Color Revolution] [Trade Aggression (Economic Warfare)] [NarcoTerrorismo] [Nitrous Mafia (NOZ)] [Group W] [Manpower (Arbeitskraft)] [Insider Threat] [Human Trafficking] Emerald Triangle (California) https:\/\/archive.org\/details\/corva2014\/Anders_Beyond_Counterculture_fsm\/ Various Photos - NSFW https:\/\/archive.org\/details\/tallulah-email Dominick R.

In 1864, this is a bit much for her Boston-bred mother to bear, but Caddie and her brothers are happy with the status quo. Written in 1935 about Carol Ryrie Brink's grandmother's childhood, the adventures of Caddie and her brothers are still exciting over 60 years later. With each chapter comes another ever-more exciting adventure: a midnight gallop on her horse across a frozen river to warn her American Indian friends of the white men's plan to attack; a prairie fire approaching the school house; and a letter from England that may change the family's life forever. This Newbery Medal-winning book bursts at the seams with Caddie's irrepressible spirit. In spite of her mother's misgivings, Caddie is a perfect role model for any girl--or boy, for that matter.

Billions died, and entire species were consumed. The few surviving humans huddled in their scattered iron and steel tombs and waited. Four hundred and fifty years after it had sealed itself off, humanity returned to the daylight and was greeted by a radically altered world - a world that logically should not exist.

The Xenozoic era is the brainchild of artist\/writer Mark Schultz, and the extraordinary adventures of the surviving humans have been published in comic form by both Kitchen Sink Press and Epic Comics.

The iconic Huntington Beach Pier, a prominent feature of the Southern California coastline, was originally constructed of wood and was already a celebrated location by 1904 when Henry Huntington's Red Car Line first rolled into the city. In 1914, a second pier was opened. Built of concrete, it was widely touted as the \"longest and highest pleasure pier\u201a\" in the country. Damaged by storms and the 1933 Earthquake, the pier was variously extended, repaired and resurfaced for the following 60 years. The pier was particularly badly damaged by a storm in 1983 and although repairs were completed, the effects of a subsequent storm in 1988 proved so severe, the pier was ordered closed. Through the fundraising efforts of a grassroots organization entitled People Interested in an Expedited Reconstruction (P.I.E.R) and others including a significant contribution by Sister City Anjo, Japan, the pier was rebuilt and reopened in 1992. Its history includes an early surfing demonstration at its opening in 1914 followed by many other surfing related events over the years, military use as lookout post during WWII, and has been a long-time film and television location. It is listed on both the California Register of Historic Places and the National Register of Historic Places. It is an international and local tourist destination, welcoming thousands of visitors each year. It is also home to numerous noteworthy events including the annual U.S. Open of Surfing. Recognizing that most if any of the pier could not be saved and would have to be rebuilt, the community held a \"Blast the Past\" ceremony. It was intended to be both a memorial to the decades of service the old pier had provided but also a celebration of hope that a new pier could be built. The ceremony was heavily attended by dignitaries and members of the public who came from all to over to witness the event. This film was professionally produced for the then-active Huntington Beach TV.

The history of surfing in Huntington Beach goes back to at least 1914 when George Freeth entertained the spectators who'd come to see the opening of the \"new\u201a\" pier in that year with a surfing demonstration. In the 1920's local boys Bud Higgins and Gene Belshe fashioned their own cumbersome boards and learned to surf with the encouragement of the legendary Duke Kahanamoku. As the years progressed, the sport was championed as a hallmark of Huntington Beach. Soldiers returning from WWII popularized the sport, having learned it first hand while stationed in the Pacific Islands. Board shops and board shapers proliferated as more and more people came to surf the waves in Huntington Beach. Jan and Dean's huge hit \"Surf City\u201a\" was written about Huntington Beach. Numerous surfing events were held. Duke Kahanamoku presided over at least five of them and the ABC channel's Wide World of Sports covered many. Eventually, Huntington Beach was recognized as \"Surf City U.S.A.\u201a\" on the floor of Congress in 1991. The title was officially registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. Today, the world's \"first and only Surfing Walk of Fame\u201a\" is a hallmark of the downtown community and the national U.S. Open of Surfing is just one of the important surfing events held in Huntington Beach. Canadian immigrant and non-surfer Natalie Kotsch, recognizing surf culture and its role in Huntington Beach history conceived of the idea of a surf museum. Collections were gathered and supporters banded together to create the first International Surf Museum in 1987. The mission of the non-profit group was \"preserving the past, participating in the present, and influencing the future of all aspects of surfing culture worldwide.\u201a\" The International Surfing Museum was located in its permanent home in the historic art deco\/moderne building that had once been the office of early Huntington Beach physician, Dr. Hawes. In the 1920s and 30s, with no hospital nearby, it had served as an emergency facility for injured oil workers. The International Surfing Museum is home to catalogued collections, rotating exhibits, and important artifacts like Kahanamoku's surfboard and the Guiness World-Record Breaking World's largest surfboard. These films show the Grand Opening celebrations of the International Surf Museum. These films were professionally produced for the then-active Huntington Beach TV.

Lived in Lumis, Independence, Big Pine. Tape 1 Side A pp. 1-18 John Baxter's grandfather came to Owens Valley, worked at Cerro Gordo, and homesteaded in Independence in 1874. John was born in Loomis, California, in 1929 and moved to Independence in 1936. He attended schools in Independence and Big Pine and recalls early school facilities, appearance of Independence and surrounding environment. Roads were not paved, making travel slow; later paved roads were narrow. \u00a0He recalls early hotels and markets. The family purchased property near Big Pine which it still owns and uses for cattle grazing. He discusses the agricultural co-op at FJrt Independence prior to World War II where displaced midwesterners farmed on land leased by the government from the City of Los Angeles. Some co-op families later integrated into town life. He explains razing and stripping of homes on lands bought by the City of Los Angeles. Indians at the Fort had their own school called the Milton School District, with teacher Ada Bell, but eventually came to Independence under unification. Indian women did laundry for town families. Introduction of alcohol had negative effect on Indian life and culture. Tape 1 Side B \u00a0pp. 18-34 Baxter describes the station at Aberdeen for the narrow gauge railroad. The Baxters leased 3,000 acres from the City of Los Angeles around the intake area for cattle grazing. His father began work for the Department of Water and Power in 1929. His mother was a homemaker; he mentions local women who worked at the courthouse. Prior to civil service, local superintendents at the DWP did all hiring and firing. He discusses relations between DWP employees and other valley residents. The valley's economic climate during the Depression was not bad, except for farmers who lost money in Watterson Inyo County Bank failure. Offers from City to buy property were welcomed \u00a0by many \u00a0ranchers who \u00a0were \u00a0not wealthy. He discusses mining efforts and methods in Mazourka Canyon; The Whiteside mine held lead deposits which were never found. He worked at Darwin for Anaconda Copper Mining Company, and lived in the camp there. He describes the mining process; products were shipped out through Lone Pine to Mojave. Small schools such as one near the Reward Mine were scattered throughout the Valley, . but were closed when the City bought up farm lands. His brother owns a mine near Aberdeen, but most claims require large investment for road work and the technology needed for conditions, such as faulting, particular to the area. The Levy brothers in Independence grubstaked miners. Tape 2 Side A \u00a0pp. 34-50 Sheep drives up the valley were common until about twenty years ago when feed dried up and the BLM regulated grazing. Stock driveways were mainly on the west side of t!ie valley; some bridges remain. Most sheepherders were Basque from Bakersfield area. Before 1900, John's grandfather built trail over Shepherd's Pass for cattle to go into summer range in the Kern River area. Indians were used to bring out lost \u00a0cattle. He recalls early. Bishop area as wet meadowlands. Social life in Owens Valley towns centered around dances, parades, school events. Shopping was mainly in Lone Pine. He describes businesses there. The winter of 1937 was hard with heavy snow and a month of freezing temperatures. He describes efforts to keep water flowing in Bishop when pipelines froze. Women doctors were in Independence and Lone Pine. The War Relocation Center at Manzanar provided some employment to valley residents. He saw camp as a necessary thing for the protection of the Japanese and as precaution against sabotage. Some local people were fearful. His father \u00a0met a former Japanese neighbor from Loomis at the camp. When barracks were dismantled, local residents bought wood and whole barracks. Carpenters brought rationed nails from camp construction to local residents. He sympathized with Japanese who lost all their \u00a0property. Tape 2 \u00a0Side B \u00a0pp. 50-66 Baxter worked briefly at Natural Soda Products (NSP) at Keeler in conditions of toxic dust. He describes chemical processes in making products from soda ash and boron at Bartlett and Keeler plants. Owens Lake water level rose during 1969 runoff and interfered with soda plant operations. He worked at Anaconda in 1955 and describes large ore deposits and milling operation. Keough's Hot Springs was a social hub and swimming pool. He visited Coso Hot Springs one time. His grandfather hauled ore from Cerro Gordo and took it by barge across Owens Lake to Mojave. He discusses his attitude and those of valley residents towards the Department of Water and Power over several decades. The DWP has made some errors; deep groundwater pumping could have severe effect on the environment. He believes that City ownership of Valley lands has prevented uncontrolled growth. The valley faces problems of few well-paying jobs and a local economy dependent on tourism. Wood camps for the railroads took many trees in the valley which have not grown back. He discusses history of the narrow gauge railroad. His brother Philip shipped out much of the honey from his bee operation on the narrow gauge at Kearsarge.\" Call Number :\u00a0ECM,OH66 Rights : Copyrighted.

As the museum matured, the member publications grew to be magazine-like time capsules showcasing science, art, and history through the unique lens of our Southern California museum. This publication contains a look into the culture of Los Angeles in the time period it was created and served as the mouthpiece to the museum.","For additional information see California Revealed ."],"title":"Terra 1990 v.29 n.1"},{"date":"1990-09-08T00:00:00Z","identifier":"calasag_000003","subject":"californialightandsound","description":"Note : Part 1 program begins at 00:01:05 after color bars.

In one proposed LASAT system, all satellites are identical and simultaneous transmission of near identical signals from several satellites creates interference at the earth receivers. Frequency hop sequence (FHS) is a new form of frequency hopping (FH) and is the proposed spread spectrum LASAT communications technique considered in this research. In military applications, the performance of the communications system in the presence of noise only, noise and jamming, noise and multipath or synchronization errors is of interest. FHS offers some immunity to jamming and multipath. This report presents the calculated noise performance of FHS in the presence of jamming, multipath and synchronization errors. For the noise only case, the calculated probability of bit error of a FHS system using eight symbols for a 10 dB value of the ratio of input bit energy to noise power density is 0.0002.","title":"Calculated noise performance of a frequency hop sequence system with applications to low altitude satellite communications"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"calculatedriskst0000stur","subject":["Risk-taking (Psychology)","Change (Psychology)"],"description":["vi, 273 pages : 28 cm","The process of taking risks -- Styles of risk-taking -- Creating your own future -- Support systems and your emerging life style"],"title":"Calculated risk : strategies for managing change"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"calculatinggrowt0000forr","title":"Calculating Growth"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"calculationchanc0000bull","subject":["Probabilities -- Juvenile literature","Mathematics -- Juvenile literature","Probabilities -- Experiments","Experiments","Mathematics","Probabilities"],"description":["48 pages : 19 x 28 cm","Presents projects and experiments exploring calculation and chance in such areas as cards, heredity, wind speed, and games","\"The Marshall Cavendish guide to projects and experiments.\"","Includes index"],"title":"Calculation and chance"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"calculationofcon00habe","description":["ADA224930","Thesis (M.S. in Mech.

The wind tunnel had sustained previous damage to one of two sets of counter-rotating blades. Because of this change in configuration, a wind tunnel calibration was deemed necessary. Along with the calibration a digital data acquisition system was designed and implemented to aid in the data collection, storage and analysis for this project and future projects, using this wind tunnel. The test section airspeed calibration data contained a substantial amount of scatter indicating flow straighteners may be required.

Following the war, Proctor continued to work as a performer and dance instructor, and she also worked as various positions as a nurse's aide, clothing designer, and a beautician, eventually opening her own beauty parlor, Eudora's House of Beauty, in Oakland in the 1950s.

Starting in 1988, the talk show hosted by Larry Mantle, was devoted to Caltech and Jet Propulsion Laboratory on the third Wednesday of every month and had the title \"AirTalk: The Caltech Edition\". The first broadcast of \"AirTalk: The Caltech Edition\" took to the airwaves on January 20, 1988. The program was aired from 6 to 7 PM on KPCC, the National Public Radio affiliate of Pasadena City College and for a few years (from 1989 to 1992) was also aired on TV channel KPAS. The show included interviews with Caltech and JPL faculty, staff, students, and alumni; as well as features such as Caltech Almanac (a detailed look at some of the many interesting people, places and discoveries in Caltech's history), Caltech Calendar (a listing of upcoming public events on campus), and Caltech in the News. Among the guests, many world-renowned scientists were interviewed: Nobel Prize and Crafoord Prize winners; former eminent Caltech and JPL administrators; and Caltech Trustees. Each of the interviewees shared with the California public their cutting-edge scientific research, their view on education and the history of Caltech.

This is a 35mm film scan from a random collection of negative film cuts labelled as \"Captain N #7\". Most, if not all, footage on this roll is from \"The Big Game\" (Season 2, Episode 5), but all of the production camera markers say \"CN#7\", so that's what we're keeping as the title of this video as well. This is not a fully edited and finished film, as the actual show was edited on videotape, but rather a 35mm negative work film intended for use with telecine\/tape editing. It contains editing instructions and informational cards for scenes. It does not include thr full episode, so it cannot be used for a complete HD reconstruction. Shots vary in quality due to seemingly inconsistent photography. A minor amount of restoration was done aside from color grading (as negatives are not color timed, unlike a print) but the footage is mostly as-is. There is no audio on this raw upload, but the YouTube upload has synced up audio from the DVD as best as reasonably possible: https:\/\/youtu.be\/314vsF4Okgg Color grading: Quazza Audio Sync: EPho3nix QC: Tanks Enjoy!

Each year they meet to discuss their ongoing campaign of debauchery and slaughter. But this year things are not going according to plan ... The story that follows spans decades and continents and penetrates the darkest recesses of the 20th century, as one man seeks to justify his belief that a secret society of powerful beings is behind many of the world's most horrific catastrophes.

This recording is the oral earthquake history of Ross Chittenden, who was a Bridge Engineer for Caltrans. When the Loma Prieta earthquake struck, he was at Candlestick Park, where he heard a noise first, then felt the jolt, then all the lights went out and the radios and TV went dead. He heard over the radio that the San Francisco Bay Bridge had been damaged, and once TV coverage came he learned about the Cypress Structure. At 6PM the game was called, and he went to his home in San Francisco. The day after the earthquake, he was requested to report to the Castro Valley office to do bridge inspections in the area. By Friday of the same week, he had been assigned to the Cypress structure. Some of the activities he assisted with were to work with the Navy para rescue who were searching all the vehicles on the collapsed structure, shoring up the structure for rescuers to go in and do rescues, and assisting with vacating buildings that were nearby.

When the Loma Prieta Earthquake happened Klemens was at home in San Mateo and he describes what he felt and saw. After the ground stopped shaking he noticed that there was a power failure, and went to shut off the gas lines. Klemens turned on a portable radio in his house to get information on what had happened, and learned that it was a major earthquake. That's when Klemens decided to go take his state car and drive to San Francisco to report to work. In the car he had a radio and was listening to the Caltrans Maintenance and Construction channels. On his drive Klemens also inspected structures, such as the 101-92 interchange, Embarcadero Freeway and James Lick Freeway. The approaches to these structures had been closed by the California Highway Patrol and Klemens observed tow truck operators towing stranded cars off of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge. While driving in San Francisco he observed that all the streetlights were out and there were many people walking outside looking at the damage around them. When he arrived at the command center at 150 Oak Street, the power was out and there was problems with the generator, so the only light available was from desk lamps. In the few days after the Loma Prieta earthquake Klemens prioritized the repair projects and hiring contractors because even with additional help from Caltrans Maintenance from all over the State there was so much work that needed to be done. Klemens was also responsible for securing materials that were needed in the repair work. Near the end of the interview Klemens shares his views on what could be done if another major earthquake happens in the future.

Another project she worked on was coordinating with the CHP at the State Operations Center to have steel girders from Texas to the Bay Bridge in two and a half days to meet deadline. The CHP provided escort for the truck drivers from Texas to the Bridge and to get clearances for night driving in certain states. Ogawa discusses how she felt much of the work that Caltrans had done was not recognized by the press and offers some suggestions of what could be done differently in the future.

In the wake of the October 17, 1989 Loma Prieta Earthquake, Caltrans commissioned an oral history project to document the personal and professional experiences of Caltrans employees who worked to restore the State's damaged transportation system. At the time of this interview James (Jim) E. Roberts was Chief of the Division of Structures for Caltrans in Sacramento. When the earthquake occurred, Roberts was at his office in Sacramento and felt the earthquake, and after the shaking stopped he went to the Seismic Analysis Unit and saw the Bay Area damage on television. After seeing the Cypress collapse he realized how serious the situation was and continued at work until late at night. The next day, Roberts with Robert Best, Director of Caltrans and Governor George Deukmejian toured the Cypress Structure, and flew over the Bay Area to survey the damage. In this interview he discusses why some of the decisions were made by Structures Division when it came to the Cypress Structure, San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge, Struve Slough, and Highway 17. When Roberts became Chief of the Division of Structures he increased efforts to seismically retrofit bridges, and due to lack of funding was to tie bridge hinges together with high-strength steel cables. He credits these efforts in reducing some of the damage done on the Cypress Structure.He also discusses the retrofit efforts that were done on San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge, and the retrofit program in general. Due to his efforts he was recognized and named to the National Academy of Engineers for work in \"the development and implementation of innovative bridge retrofit concepts and criteria under seismic conditions\" in 1996.

Wes Jackson, Director of the Land Institute and artist Ann Hamilton will speak about ethical approaches to the land and their work. For the past twelve years, Wes has been investigating sustainable alternatives to agriculture, energy, waste management, and shelter through The Land Institute. He will contrast the equilibrium of the tended earth maintained by Native Americans for millennia with the intrusive mentality with which western expansion has frequently destroyed our ultimate resource, the land. Trained as a geneticist, Wes has incorporated a wide range of influences into the development of The Land Institute. Ann Hamilton, an artist who is currently renovating the Center's Mess Hall, will discuss the ethic of tending and participation which informs the development of her work.

After a short recall of anatomical and morphological structures, he recapitulates the great lineages of the modern taxonomical classification of this group until the level of the subfamilies. The first part deals with the biology of the reproduction and the embryonic and postembryonic development, and underlines the very exceptional character of the morphogenesis during the reproductive stage in some species: the appearance of the epitokous form during the vitellogenesis in Hypogastrura, Hydroisotoma; the regress of the secondary sexual characters in Bourletiella submited to dry summer conditions. Likewise are described the results of the mesological effects on the adaptative ecophysiology, on the cuticular patterns and the relationship between cuticular organization and ecological factors with adaptative significance. Next the author gives the essential description of the morphological modifications, the transformations of the internal anatomy and the phenological evolution of the populations, which characterize the ecomorphic crisis during the seasonal cycle in some Hypogastruridae and Isotomidae. The most recent data of cytogenetic (analysis of the polytene karyotypes of the salivary glands), endocrinology (study of the retrocerebral neuroendocrine system) and chronobiology (circadian-circaseptan rhythm) complete this panorama.","title":"Des Hexapodes vieux de 400 millions d'ann\u00e9es: les Collemboles.

He proposes an ecological classification of the organisms based on the adaptation to the different environments: from the strictly edaphic superficial layers (humus, moss on the soil...) the evolution generates a great taxonomical diversity to the other peripheral surroundings: grassland, deep soil, water surface, marine sands, caves ... Next the factors of the species distribution are analysed on two levels: on the one hand, small-scale chorological factors connected with the paleogeography and the continental drift; on the other hand, strictly present large-scale mesological factors (especially climatic and microclimatic components). The author shows likewise the position of the Collembola in the food chain of the edaphic biocenosis and the part of 'these in the pedogenesis. The impact of the human interventions on the biocenotical stability is analysed in the last part of this work: deforestation and afforestation, soil ploughing, use of pesticides, fire, stamping of edaphics layers...","title":"Des Hexapodes vieux de 400 millions d'ann\u00e9es: les Collemboles.

For over 50 years, Stinson Beach Allied Arts was a vital part of the Stinson Beach community. It was founded in 1946 with 37 charter members in order \"to stimulate, promote and support creative activities in Stinson Beach and to support in every way the aims, endeavors and goals of the Stinson Beach Community Center, Inc.\" Members worked hard for civic improvements and focused on creating what is now the Community Center complex. In addition, they offered financial support to many cultural, health, welfare, and educational organizations in Marin County, including Stinson Beach Montessori School, West Marin Community Chorus, West Marin Health Alliance, Senior Services and Hospice of Marin. Fundraising efforts were supported by their famous Annual Rummage Sale and Christmas Bazaar. Their Wildflower Shows became so famous they outgrew the town and moved to the Oakland Museum, where they are still held annually on Mother's Day weekend. Allied Arts held their last meeting in May 2000, signaling the passing of a generation."],"title":"Stinson Beach Allied Arts 1991-2000 minutes"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"castillos0000wolf","subject":["Wolf, Reinhart, 1930-1988","Castles -- Spain","Castles -- Spain -- Pictorial works","Cha\u0302teaux forts -- Espagne -- Ouvrages illustre\u0301s","Cha\u0302teaux -- Espagne -- Ouvrages illustre\u0301s","Cha\u0302teaux -- Espagne","Castles","Spain"],"description":"111 pages : 20 cm","title":"Castillos"},{"date":"1990-01-01T00:00:00Z","identifier":"castingcirclewo00stei","subject":["Ritual","Women","Goddess religion"],"description":"Includes bibliographical references (p.
